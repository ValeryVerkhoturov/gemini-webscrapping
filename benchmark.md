Liberty Restoration has received overwhelmingly negative reviews from customers.  Many customers report a pattern of taking deposits and then failing to complete the work, often for months.  Customers report being ignored and unable to reach anyone in the company after the deposit is paid.  There are also reports of shoddy workmanship and unfinished jobs.  Some customers report being threatened with liens if they don't pay despite incomplete work.  The few positive reviews are from customers who had a positive experience with the company's sales staff, but their projects also often had issues with delays and communication after the deposit was paid.  Overall, Liberty Restoration appears to be a company that prioritizes profits over customer service and quality of work.  Avoid this company.

Great Lakes Roofing & Exteriors, owned by Blake Hoogterp, has been accused of taking money and failing to finish jobs. Hoogterp has a history of criminal cases, including a 2022 conviction for using a customer's credit card without authorization.  Multiple homeowners have complained that Hoogterp left projects unfinished and stopped returning calls.  Neither the BBB nor Michigan’s Licensing Agency has a record of Hoogterp or his company.  The company has received negative reviews on Nextdoor.  Customers say Hoogterp is personable and responsive initially, but when problems arise, he becomes unresponsive and provides excuses for the delays.  Homeowners are advised to do their research before hiring a contractor.  They should check the individual or firm through Google and bbb.org, verify licenses through the state, get multiple bids, put everything in writing, and never pay in full until the job is done.

Erie Home is a roofing company that has been accused of using high-pressure sales tactics. A consumer investigator found that an 82-year-old woman was charged $98,000 for a new roof, and the salesman wouldn't take no for an answer. The company said they pride themselves on delivering high-quality service to all customers and that their pricing reflects the value of the services, quality, and warranty they provide. A second roofer found that the price of the roof was about three times as much as what it should have been. The consumer investigator recommends getting multiple quotes and walking away from high-pressure salespeople.

Louisiana State Police is investigating Texas law firm McClenny Moseley & Associates and Alabama construction contractor Apex Roofing & Restoration for alleged insurance fraud. The investigation is based on an earlier investigation by the Louisiana Department of Insurance. LDI investigators found that MMA collected insurance proceeds from 25 Apex customers even though they never hired MMA to represent them. 

The LSP investigation is looking into possible charges for insurance fraud, forgery, bank fraud, and unlawful solicitation by attorneys.

The article describes how MMA allegedly used a document called an assignment of benefits to go after homeowners' insurance money.  It also highlights allegations that Apex was misled by MMA about their dealings with homeowners' insurance claims. 

Apex denies any wrongdoing and has filed a malpractice lawsuit against MMA. 

This appears to be a complex case involving alleged fraud and misconduct by multiple parties, with potential far-reaching consequences for those involved.

The reviews express a range of opinions on the L&I department's enforcement of safety regulations for roofers. Many reviewers believe the fines are excessive and the regulations are overly strict, arguing that the workers are ultimately responsible for their own safety and that the fines will drive businesses out of operation. Some reviewers feel the fines are justified and that the state is right to enforce safety regulations, emphasizing the dangers of roof work and the importance of protecting workers. There is a general consensus that the cost of compliance with L&I regulations is high and that the state's minimum wage and gas prices are some of the highest in the nation.

Veterans Roofing, owned by Tom Bouhan, has faced numerous complaints, police reports, and civil lawsuits. Since 2019, 21 customers have filed complaints with the Georgia's Attorney General's consumer protection division, and ten customers and a subcontractor have filed police reports against Bouhan. Bouhan has also been sued multiple times, including one lawsuit in 2020 where a customer alleged that Bouhan collected the insurance claim check, replaced the roof, but never paid the subcontractors. The homeowner ended up paying the subcontractors himself to remove a lien on his home. A Gwinnett County judge awarded a default judgement for the refund, legal fees, and punitive damages totaling $98,000. This situation highlights a pattern of complaints against Veterans Roofing and Tom Bouhan. The Better Business Bureau has issued Veterans Roofing LLC an F rating, indicating a serious lack of trust in the company's business practices.

GoodLeap, a solar panel financing company, is facing accusations of exploiting elderly homeowners. Several complaints have been filed against the company with the Texas Attorney General's Office, alleging that their parents were misled about the true cost of solar panels and signed contracts they did not fully understand. 
GoodLeap has an A- rating with the Better Business Bureau, but several customers are now calling for stricter regulations in the solar industry to protect vulnerable homeowners. 
While GoodLeap claims to actively monitor contractors and cut ties when necessary, their involvement in a 2022 lawsuit by the Minnesota Attorney General's Office highlights the potential liability they face as a lender. 
The I-Team urges consumers to be cautious and do their research before signing any solar panel contracts.

Robert Cerimele, a Valley roofing contractor, was arrested and charged with theft after a neighbor reported that he paid Cerimele for work that was never completed. The neighbor claimed he gave Cerimele a $3,500 check in late May to replace his roof. Cerimele was booked into Mahoning County Jail on Friday and released on New Year’s Day. Cerimele’s hearing date has not been set. 

This case highlights the importance of thoroughly vetting contractors before hiring them. Cerimele is now facing a charge of theft, and it’s likely that the homeowner will be left to pay for the roof replacement themselves. It’s always a good idea to check a contractor’s licensing and insurance, and to read online reviews from previous customers.
