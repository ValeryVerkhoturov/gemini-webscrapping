Message: Hired them for a full roof replacement in 2021.  In 2024 STILL having issues with the new roof as we have discovered the 4th leak.
Previous leaks caused damage (they repaired) in the garage.
Other major leak caused damage to the wood ceiling in main room.  Trying to fix - but the stains will always be there and noticeable.  There are drywall stains in several places in the house now.
As we replace carpet - we've now found another leak again that is active.
I know they sell it - and someone else does the work.  This has been a horrible project that never seems to stop having issues.  At least we did get the roof we paid for, but the headaches and damage to the property since are not worth it.
The main number listed on the website no longer is valid.
Am currently waiting on return phone calls and to fix the active leak again.

Message: This post is about Liberty Restoration, a local roofing company.
2 yrs ago they put a roof on for me,all seemed to be ok except when we had a chimney cap put on 1 yr ago and the guy doing it said there was a shoe print that was indented into the roof down to the wood. Called them and they fixed it, I think.  This past summer I had my gutters cleaned, was told that my gutters were clogged with cement, nails and roofing stuff!  They cleaned it out,I decided to get new gutters. Now find out the shingles were put OVER the gutter extension and glued/nailed into place and guess who won&rsquo;t answer my calls now unless I call from a phone # they don&rsquo;t know as mine?!?  The gutter company can&rsquo;t pull the old gutters off d/t them being glued/nailed into old gutters w/o ripping shingles off and Liberty Restoration manager won&rsquo;t call me back or take my calls now!  Buyer beware.

We were finally able to get a phone number for josh b******* who is apparently the CEO of this company. He did answer my call, however he stated he didn&rsquo;t know what the problem was he but that he could see the order had been placed. he said windows would be done in 2 weeks.

Message: Do not use Liberty Restoration, they did substandard work and do not return my communications.  Liberty Restoration installed an entire roof and siding on a section of my home.  When they were installing the siding, the supervisor told me that this was their first time installing this type of siding.  I was told that I would get a crew with experience.  It was installed on March 8 and 9 of 2023.  They ran out of the custom-colored siding and decided to paint the other remaining boards with a different color.  The painted boards do not match the custom-colored ones.  Also, a board that was not attached properly fell off during a storm on April 4.  We contacted Chris H***** of Liberty Restoration on April 5 to have someone replace the board and he said he would have it repaired right away.  Chris H***** also promised us that since this was an inferior installation, they would redo it.   Nothing has been done so far.  After calling and texting Chris H***** several times without any action, I called Josh B*******, the President of Liberty Restoration.  I spoke with Josh B******* on June 23, 2023, and he said that he would look into the issues and get back with me.  I have called and left several messages and have emailed him twice.  He has not gotten back with me.
Liberty Restoration also installed a roof on my house on October 14. 2022.  As a part of the settlement that I will receive from the insurance company, I need a "Certificate of Completion" in order to collect the remainder of the payment.  I have requested this information from both Chris H***** and Josh B******* several times and they are unwilling to provide it.  I do not understand why, unless they did not do the work properly and do not want to provide false documents to the insurance company.
Additionally, there is damage to some of the shingles due to them removing the old boards from the house.

But no call back. Then the location in Houston closed so we lost contact for awhile. Finally got ahold of someone was told I would get a call back the following day never did!

Name: Ivan D

Message: I worked with Ben R**** as the salesman. He is a pleasure to work with. I also worked with Angela (did not get a last name) at their office and she was also a pleasure to work with. Angela helped sort an issue with the insurance company not sending a supplemental check.
Josh, who I understand is the owner was not a pleasure to work with. My initial contact with Liberty was in February of this year. The sales process was smooth. The roof replacement was covered by insurance and Ben and company were helpful in communications with the insurance company. The initial check was cashed by Liberty on July 7th. At that point, I received radio silence. At first I did not request any updates but as weeks became months, I had to push for communications and figure out a way to contact someone to get on the schedule for a roof replacement. After multiple phone calls, we finally got on the build schedule in November. The process was not anything like initially explained. We were given a date and told if we didn&rsquo;t accept, it would be pushed into next year. Keep in mind this is 4 months after Liberty cashed a check for thousands of dollars for this build. Upon completion, we quickly received an invoice for the remainder of the build. The check took some time to receive from our insurance and when it did, they had not paid for the ice and water shield. Angela helped resolve this. A few days later, after a couple of missed calls from Angela during the time I was at work, I received a call from Josh during business hours. As I answered frustrated that I was being hounded during business hours, he took on a combative tone and threatened a lien on the home of the payment. Keep in mind that this had been a month after the build date and that the initial check which was missing the ice and water shield took two weeks to arrive.
It is evident that the primary focus of upper management is payment and not customer service. If I could go back in time, I would choose to use ******&nbsp;instead.

I have been dealing with them for over 6 months now since I signed the contract in May 2022 and made the deposit with no indications when my roof installation will start.  Liberty was aggressive and consistent in communicating until they received my deposit.  Everything is in limbo after that.  If they knocked in your door, dont entertain their representative and instead look for other contractor that is honest and trustworthy.  I dont recommend Liberty Restoration to anyone.

Message: Liberty Restoration would be happy to make multiple trips to your home to waste your time by talking you into a roof and how they can get insurance company to pay for it all. They were more than happy to converse wit me for months on end unitl they get the insurance money then you will never hear from them again. The more I inquire about the install date for my roof the nastier they get. They promised a roof install 8 weeks after they took our money, then said now it would be October, they never called to set a date and its been 6 months. Come to find out they are not licensed in Parma to pull a permit and do the work anyways, Just by them going house to house is illegal and they can be fined for trying to sell you work they can even start in the first place. But you better believe their very persuasive salesman that they will do the work. They won't return your call's once they know you are on to them, and start to smart mouth from that time forward.Now my only choice is to take them to court to get my money back. This company is the worst I've ever delt with and I'm very stressed but all their lies. They deserve zero stars for doing noting and for treating me disrespectful.

Message: This company seemed great when they were trying to get our business. After 6 months of a long dragged out process to finalize the insurance claim, we were promised our project was finally just 2 weeks out. Then, they picked up our $20K check and all communication stopped dead. No responses to calls or texts. Nothing.We tried to contact their various numbers online and left messages, but they all went to answering machines and no calls were ever returned. I was even redirected to a ****** mailbox that was out of order. Finally... we tried the number on the ******** page and for once someone answered. They assured me that everything was on track and that our account was being handed directly to the owner, ****, who told us to contact him directly from now on and promised he'd get back to us within an hour. Well, we've called every day this week so far, and guess what the response has been? Nothing. We're back to the answering machine. Our entire neighborhood had damage to their roofs back in early spring, and every other home has had already their roofs repaired months ago. It's almost November, and we're still waiting. They promised us they'd get here in early summer to repair some major damage to our deck which our little two year old is playing on every day. Guess what? Nothing. We've held off getting our gutters cleaned because our job was just 4 weeks out, 6 weeks out, 2 weeks out again and again. Guess what our gutters look like now? We have 1 foot tall grass growing in them. Don't be fooled by the fancy pamphlets or the appearance of being a large company. There's one office, in ****, where no one answers the phone, and based upon the ******** reviews they appear to have shafted their contractors in a number of other states.

Message: I had Liberty Restoration complete a re-roof on my business. This is a large scale flat roof TPO job that they took care of for me. They laid out clear time frames and expectations for our project. The sales rep walked me through the process every step of the way. Once we signed the contract, the production team reached out to me and provided me with a "day of the build" packet and a build date. We got delayed due to weather 1 week, but in that time I was made aware of this and given a new build date. The communication was top notch! Once the job was completed, the crew cleaned everything up and the sales rep came back out to do a walk though. I would recommend Liberty to everyone!

Message: Stay away from this company. They take the homeowners deposit and don't actually do the work. Some customers have been waiting over 6 months with no way to get the job done or get their money back. Then when the job actually does get done if your lucky they don't pay the sub-contractor that actually installed the roof. Just do yourself a favor and stay away. Even contacting the orginal salesman is sometimes a bust because they cannot get commissions on jobs because the install date takes forever that they have to leave and go find other jobs or start their own roofing company that actually cares about their customers and crews.

Message: Communication, integrity, and customer service are not attributes that describe Liberty Restorations Group of ****************.I started working with Liberty Restoration's ******* branch in January 2022 after.  I was approached by a project manager (*************************).  He asked if he could inspect my roof because he saw where there were several shingles missing on the right front side of my roof, perhaps from wind damage.  Subsequently, I filed a claim with my insurance company and an inspection was scheduled with them on January 18.  Along the way there were additional inspections, but at one point, the ** from Liberty stopped communicating with me.  I found out from the company's general manager (*******************) that ***** stopped communicating with other customers as well, because he quit working with the company.  The ** took over my account and diligently worked with me from March 2022 to now (July 2022) to get my insurance company to cover the cost for a new roof; we were both excited about this accomplishment.  The problem is Liberty corporate is not communicating with me or the ** on a scheduled date for the job after I gave the company a $1,000 deposit on 7/1.  I was told by Liberty's corporate contact that I would receive a date for the roof repair from the company's operations department. No such luck.  I followed up with the ** on 7/5 to see if he knew of the date and he hadn't. I have left telephone messages with Liberty's corporate office at least three times and sent a text message and so has the ** in *******.  As of July 18, I have yet to hear from Liberty's corporate office. Either Liberty repairs my roof or returns my deposit so that I can contract with another roofing company who provides better customer service (communication, integrity, and caring about the needs of its customers).

Approx. 25 mins later, my neighbor shows up with the appraiser ****************, my neighbor went on to explain that he caught this guy deliberately denting my gutters with a tape measure to make it look like hail damage.  The cops were already called and ****** admitted to everything, only to change his story when he was by himself with the police officer.  The next day, I immediately called **** ** supposed owner of this company.  He said he was looking into things and would call me back the next business days.  After more then enough time and attempts, he would not answer or return my calls.  Finally my daughter called, he proceeded to tell her that he tried to call and leave a message, but didn't keep trying because he didn't "know if she was on vacation".  I never received a call, no voicemail was ever left.  When I did get to talk to **** again, he asked if he could come out and take some more photos, I agreed although photos were already available through the police.  He never showed up, more excuses, but eventually sent out another **** **** M, he listened and assured he would take care of things.  In true Liberty Restoration fashion he didn't keep his word either, and his communication is just as bad as ****'s. To sum things up, they were supposed to replace my downspouts the first week of June, here we are 6/25 and nothing , I left **** a message on 6/10 asking for an update and he has yet to call back.  At one point, I asked for the money to take care of it myself, their response was that they "wanted to make sure the job got done", whatever that meant - we are going into a 3 month nightmare, for vandalism on my property and I haven't got anything - no downspouts, no communication,  no resolution, nothing.   The ethics of this company is truly one of the worse I've ever dealt with - downspouts just isn't enough at this point.

Name: Trisha P

Message: I contacted Liberty for a roof insurance claim in July 2021 because the previous roofing company I was working with had not meet their commitments. I could have handled that experience better so I actively worked to maintain a positive attitude and be ****** nice to this company in the midst of a pandemic. My efforts were rewarded with Liberty continually missing commitments and threatening my property and livelihood. I explained to EVERY associate that I worked with at Liberty that I was moving and time was of the essence, it seems no one cared until it may effect them financially. I finally got insurance approval and gave Liberty a $5500 deposit 9/10, I was given a 4 week lead time. Liberty then basically disappeared, no return phone calls, texts, etc. I literally get more updates on a $30 order from Amazon. After 4 reschedules where I was never proactively informed there was a delay, my roof was installed early December. Unfortunately that was just the beginning of my frustration. My siding was significantly damaged in the install. Photos available. Liberty now began their games, missed appointments to check the siding, times I had taken off of work to meet them, lack of follow up and return phone calls. I called Liberty week after week to close this issue and pay the final balance. This past week, I called the accounting contact *************************** on Monday, I hadnt heard anything in two weeks, she hadnt returned my call the week earlier. She said she would call me back that afternoon or the following day. Neither commitment was met. Wednesday I was told that now there is no way the siding would be fixed in time for closing, putting my house sale in jeopardy, after I had told it would be taken care of. I explained to both ****** and *********************** that I was not comfortable paying my balance until my siding was repaired and the full job was complete, they simply had not followed through with their promises. There was zero pushback to that until Thursday at 12 pm when ****** left me a voicemail telling me that I must pay them $6000 before the end of the day or they are placing a lien in my home. They also informed me that they were charging me an additional $1200 in fees related to that. Again there had NEVER been any notification or conversation of late fees, issues with payment with ANYONE I had spoken to until then. I was forced to leave a very important meeting at my job to respond to their ****** demands. I was told that the additional charges would be waived if I gave them a credit card immediately, intimidation tactics at their best. Thank goodness I documented all of this verbally (recorders phone call where I notified ****** and written). Mind you this company continually responded to my inquiries days late, but I was expected to give them $6000 within 3 hours. While on the line with ****** she showed zero remorse for her incompetence, and when I escalated to the *** it was met with mansplaining of lien laws by ************************* and a commitment he would help. Not the case, the next day, even though I had paid their demands, I was issued a late notice on their trumped up fees I had never been made aware of. **** was unavailable at the direct phone number he gave me. Bottom line, I did everything in my power to have a positive experience with this company and they responded by treating me like a criminal and putting my home sale in jeopardy. These are not people who you want to deal with.

Message: Liberty Restoration should never replace a roof on a home. An insurance claim was submitted by the previous owners of my home. The claim was made to replace the roof due to weather damage. The roof was replaced during the pending period of the sale of the home. Within a month after the roof was replaced I moved into the house and noticed a few issues with the roof. A downspout on top of the sunroom was moving in the wind.  As I looked further, I noticed the siding flapping in the wind, and pieces missing on the top of the house. The following day it rained and above my bedroom window a waterfall was "flooding" the window.  I  immediately called Liberty Restoration to see if they could come out and see what i am seeing.  I also advised them that we have the warranty that transferred from the sale of the home, copies of the invoice of the replaced roof. The roof at this point was two months old and Liberty Restoration refused to help me. I was told that I am not their customer and they would not come out to the home to see the issues that I addressed..  I ended up spending $3k to have these issues repaired from another company. They replaced the ridge vent, reattached the siding, reattached the spout, cleaned out roofing debris from the gutters that caused the "waterfall" by the bedroom window, replaced buckled tiles, and caulked exposed nailheads. Liberty Restoration collected a $17K insurance claim and would not bother to address any issues brought to their attention, their concern is making money and nothing more.

Name: Justin Gray, WSB-TV

Message: A Cobb County woman was charged over $90,000 for a new roof. Marie Kleber, 82, of Marietta, told Channel 2 consumer investigator Justin Gray that the loan she took out will likely outlive her. She told Gray that her troubles began last fall when she had an Erie Home salesman come out to give her a quote. She said the salesman wouldn’t take no for an answer. Kleber said she was never shown a contract or interest rate for the financing but was pushed to sign her name on an electronic device. Nearly one year later, she noticed the roof was separating from the house and began pressing Erie to send her a copy of the contract. When it arrived, she was stunned to find out the interest rate was nearly 10%. Channel 2 Action News reached out to Stephen McGrew with Academy Roofing to get another quote for Kleber’s home. McGrew ran Kleber’s home through Academy’s computer modeling system and looked a satellite images. Erie Home rates just four out of five stars on the review site Yelp, with multiple consumers pointing to high-pressure sales tactics. Gray reached out to Erie Home multiple times and visited a local office. McGrew said Academy always recommends homeowners get multiple quotes and warns consumers to walk away from high-pressure salespeople. Kleber told Gray she believes the salesman who came to her home saw her as an easy mark because of her age and beautiful home. A home she’s now considering selling.

No wonder this state is one of the most expensive places to live in this nation. They are always coming up with new regulations against businesses, which, in turn, makes things expensive for everyone, and then when things get expensive, they give everyone a raise through their ever-increasing minimum wage mandates. For example, solely due to their regulations and mandates, this state has the highest minimum wage in the country. The gas price has risen this year to the second highest in the nation only after California.  I guarantee you that next year the gas price in this state will beat California.

The fines 3 m but the price for doing the job never increases and if one of them gets injured 100% it’s a tool mishap / nail in the hand or foot or cut by a saw or knife. The roofs that are steep enough for a worker to consider full safety are the ones they use it. I’ve been in the industry for 2 decades and have never seen someone fall from a low pitch roof,  you have to be stupid to walk off the edge .

Message: Crazy. In the Philippines it's much worse. Nobody follows safety even if you provide the equipment it's the worker's that don't want to use them. I can attest to this being an Architect in our country. This is wrong to put someone out of business for this. 3M USD fine is too much. Profits won't cover for that. The state is crazy. Warning and compliance first then if they don't do anything about it then sure warn that they will receive penalties but 3M is just WRONG. The workers should all receive warnings that they should comply and use the equipment provided them. I can see the harnesses but they don't use the anchors. Most roofers will say it hampers how they work on the roof. These guys are the ones at fault for hurting their employer. I know this as a fact. For the employer: there has to be someone at the site handling safety. I know how difficult people are at following rules. I guess greed has no bounds. That penalty is even more criminal. Daylight robbery.

Name: Ava Boldizar

Message: COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – A Columbus-based roofing contractor, accused of pocketing nearly $45,000 in payments from four customers without finishing or starting projects, is being sued by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. 

The lawsuit alleges “Ryan Roofing & Home Improvements” and its owner, Anthony Ryan, sold roofing services to customers and accepted deposits from those customers or their insurance companies, but did not deliver the promised work. 

The lawsuit also maintains that Ryan did not issue refunds or provide his clients with the legally mandated notice to cancel their contracts. It alleges violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act and the Home Solicitation Sales Act.

The Ohio Attorney General’s Office and the Better Business Bureau filed four consumer complaints, with damages of at least $44,993. Yost’s lawsuit seeks to compel Ryan and his company to reimburse the affected consumers, pay civil penalties and cover court costs, according to the attorney general’s office.

Name: Don Dare

Message: A Knoxville widow is pursuing a felony charge against an East Tennessee roofer after signing a contract in May to have her roof replaced, but to date, nothing has happened. Lois and her late husband bought their West Knoxville home in 1979. The roof was replaced once before. Lois was worried recently about a low part in the middle of the roof that appeared to be sagging. She hired Roger Blankenship to fix a leak in the roof above her kitchen window last November. She found JWB Roofing and Repairs of Jacksboro on Angie’s List. Blankenship had a partnership with another roofer at the time. The $2,100 repair to a section of the back roof went smoothly a year ago and Lois said there were no problems at all. She hired Blankenship again in May 2023 to replace her entire roof. He had changed the name of his business to Lucky Star Roofing and Repair Services. The contract for $9,500 was signed by Blankenship on May 12. She paid two-thirds of the total cost in advance. “He said he would start the following week,” said Lois. “He never came back that week. It wasn’t until I heard from him again on Memorial Day when he said he needed an additional $500 cash to cover a dumpster.” The dumpster never arrived in either June, July, or August. Then Lois received a relatively optimistic text in September. “Wrote back to me, ‘I promise I’m going to do right by you. You will get your new roof.’ It always seems to be the dumpster. He can’t get this dumpster. It’s not there. They don’t have one. Anyway, I still haven’t gotten my roof. Now, I’m out $7,000,” said Lois. Earlier this year, Michael Pinner showed WATE a number of leaks in the ceiling of his mobile home. He called because the roofers he hired never showed up. The company was JWB Roofing and Repairs, the same business Lois had hired last year. Pinner paid nearly $7,000 in advance to the roofers. We got through to Roger Blankenship’s partner in early August and asked about the unfinished job. Pinner’s contract was signed by Blankenship. Within a few days, he was reimbursed for a job that never started. He said the $8,000 refund came from Blankenship’s former partner and Pinner said Roger Blankenship never followed through. We contacted Blankenship to ask about Lois’s new roof. We left a message reminding Blankenship about his last text in which he promised he was going to do right by Lois and that he would get a new roof on her home. “I would like my money back so I can find somebody to do it,” Lois said. “I trusted this man because he had worked with me before. Obviously, he took my money and ran.” Blankenship called us back after we had left a message. He assured us, he would finish Lois’ roof. He intends to get it done, he claimed, by the second week in December. We asked why is it going to take nearly another month since he’s had her money for six months. He said he’s “had poor health” recently and is still recovering. He also called Lois. She said he promised her, she would get a new roof. In the meantime, Lois has contacted the sheriff’s department seeking a possible felony investigation for theft, in case Blankenship doesn’t follow through.

Name: U.S. Attorney’s Office,               District of New Jersey

Message: A construction company based in Old Bridge, New Jersey, admitted violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, leading to the death of an employee, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.

Zona Roofing LLC (Zona Roofing), via its owner Yilbert Segura, pleaded guilty on Nov. 20, 2023, before U.S. Magistrate Judge José R. Almonte in Newark federal court to an information charging it with one count of willfully violating OSHA standards by failing to provide fall protection and fall protection training to employees engaged in the replacement of a residential roof, which caused the death of an employee. 

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:

On Aug. 6, 2019, Segura and four employees began a roof replacement project on a residential home located in Haledon, New Jersey. Despite working more than 20 feet from the ground, employees for Zona Roofing were not equipped with any personal fall protection equipment, such as safety harnesses, lanyards, tie-off ropes, guard rails, safety nets, or other feasible means of fall protection. None of the employees had received fall protection training to recognize the hazards of falling or the procedures to be followed to minimize those hazards.

On Aug. 8, 2019, while working on the roof, one of Zona Roofing’s employees lost his balance and fell approximately 22 feet to the ground, sustaining blunt force injuries to his head that resulted in his death. The employee was not equipped with any fall protection gear, and he had not received any fall protection training. Zona Roofing was previously cited by Maryland OSHA in February 2019 for failing to provide fall protection to its employees.

If the court accepts the terms of the plea agreement, Zona Roofing will be sentenced to five years of probation and will pay restitution of $75,000 to the employee’s family members. Zona Roofing must also follow specified conditions, including providing training procedures to all its employees and a requirement to follow enhanced safety provisions for future construction jobs. Sentencing is scheduled for March 25, 2024.

U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger credited special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Inspector General, Northeast Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone; Daniel Hennefeld, Counsel for Occupational Safety and Health, Office of the Solicitor of Labor, Region 2, and OSHA Compliance Officers with the investigation leading to the guilty plea.

The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Garrett Schuman of the Criminal Division in Newark.

Name: Lexi Salazar, Andrea Lucia, Scott Fralicks

Message: Jan Jones' stepmother took out a $60,000 loan with GoodLeap to finance solar panels, a debt her father will now assume with their house as collateral. Jones believes her stepmother, who struggled with dementia, was misled about the cost of the panels by Daybreak Solar. The contract with GoodLeap will cost nearly $87,000 by the time it's paid off. The I-Team reviewed numerous complaints against solar companies, with many customers feeling deceived about the true cost. Consumer experts warn of misleading tactics used by some contractors, such as overstating potential savings and promising large tax cuts. GoodLeap has an A- rating with the BBB but has received complaints about potential elder abuse. A spokesperson for GoodLeap said it takes such complaints seriously but is prohibited by law from considering age when writing a loan. The company monitors contractors and cuts ties when necessary. GoodLeap was named in a 2022 lawsuit by the Minnesota AG's office, accusing solar panel companies of fraud and invoking the Holder Rule, which holds lenders liable for products they finance. The suit ended in a settlement with no admission of wrongdoing by GoodLeap. Jones and her father are exploring options to get out of the loan agreement.

While the sales agent didn't tell me that after 18 months my payment to GoodLeap would increase if I had not set up anadditional amount, GoodLeap NEVER reached out, OR communicated with me to see if I was aware of the change UNTIL the week it was increasing. I'm a 100% disabled veteran who got the the solar panels because I nor my 81 yr old mother who is also a 100% veteran could operate a generator.There's been no communications by phone, email OR regular mail for the past 18 months. The week of March 25, 2024 was the FIRST time I received a call from GoodLeap, they kept a voicemail and I called back. I ended up talking to *************************, who then blamed my installer of the solar panels for the lack of communications from GoodLeap. ******* also would not allow me to complete my sentences and would continue to talk over me. ******* never wanted to escalate the issue to a higher department or individual, he would rather sit there reading the same information like a broken record, this was on Good Friday. I finally, through a recording, found out who ********* supervisor was, *************************, who I immediately reached out to. She also, has been no help as she would rather blame the installers for GoodLeap never reaching out in the past 18 months to make sure I understood the payment increase to come. I and my mother are 100% disabled veterans on a fixed income. We budget everything and if we had known that paying a little 26% each month in the first 18 months would have stopped a $100 increase, we would have added that to our ACH monthly payments. I didn't even receive the financial documents from GoodLeap UNTIL this week when I found out about the increase in monthly payments. There have been MANY lawsuits AGAINST GoodLeap since I signed with them and there have been OVER 50 pages of complaints filed with the BBB about them.

Message: Here is my experience with GoodLeap 1. there is no way to make extra payments that go solely towards the principle of your loan. Any $ you pay goes towards paying their loan interest, first. This is not what I was told when I agreed to this loan. I would never have opened this account had I known this at the time. What I was told verbally when opening this loan, does not match what is in their contract. Shame on Me for not paying better attention to pages 5 - 8 of this contract. I, instead, trusted the GoodLeap Team member I spoke with over the phone, when I was setting up this loan.2. They start charging you interest right away BUT, they dont take their 1st payment for 2 months! I was also told that I was not able to make online payments, until the 1st payment was taken out. Therefore, I was being forced to have interest incurred.Buyer Beware!

Message: They tell you the payment wont go up that much, but mine went up over $100 in less than a year, so I am not saving on my electricity. I think all these good comments are fake or people just starting out. If I could go back, I definitely wouldn't sign up. I am also curious to find out what these lawsuits against them are about. I left a bad review when I first signed up saying I was misinformed. They came out to visit me and asked for me to remove my negative review, but after rude customer service from one of their employees and seeing my payment go up, I had to come and leave another review so others won't get fooled.

Message: I agreed to solar panels with Helios Solar based on the payment of $150 a month, through Goodleap. Also, I was told that I would receive Federal and State funds to help pay for them. This was all decided in February 2022. I signed the loan documents, and it was all ready to go around November 2022. The company didn't show up until March or April, 2023, to put them on. After everything was done and the solar panels were placed and hooked up...I got a phone call that I was no longer approved for the loan. Goodleap ran my credit again, for some reason, without my permission. The score was lower due to a program I had entered to remove a creditor I had. I will be looking into some legal advice for both Goodleap and Helios Solar. I will also be reviewing Helios Solar. Both are shady so BEWARE

This was supposed to be a steady payment until her solar panels were paid off. I recently saw a bill from them with a balance of over $40K, what in the world?

Message: This company is the epidemy of worst companies.  I've had my house under contract twice and both times I lost the sale due to goodleap.  They failed not only once but twice to disclose the criteria for an individual to take over the loan.  They continued to give false information and change it each time a new buyer ( who mind you was qualified to purchase a ******* dollar home but not consume a 34k solar loan) We were told when we called to see why they could not get approved - the 1st buyers was due to credit that we were told was a 650, then changed to a 680.  Yet they could get approved for a half a million dollar home but not 34k in solar.. what a joke.  The second buyer well exceeded the 680 and debt to ratio requirements then they threw another requirement into the mix that was NEVER disclosed when asked the first time. I asked for the criteria to to be sent to me that they failed to ever do so we would not run into this again.  When potential buyers contacted them they were rude would not give any other options to try and get approval other than buy the solar outright.  I had to contact my attorney who is starting the proceedings for the loss of two sales due to lack of documentation and communication when asked for from goodleap. Mind you - none of the criteria is in a legally binding document only given to you verbally.  I would never use them- never recommend them and strongly encourage anyone looking to install solar on their home to stay as far away from them as you can.  I look forward to long battle with them legally more due to morals than anything else.

Message: Considering a loan-Beware!!!! Their contract states you can pay off early with now penalties but that is clearly not the case. I took out a large loan for home repair and was told I could pay off early, when I called in to pay off the loan I was not informed of any additional costs other than the loan amount. They took my money no problem but then still sent me mail reminders that payment was going to be taken automatically from my account. I called them about this and then they told me I had a ***** UCC termination amount that I owed. This is apparently a fee for documentation submitted to the county that they paid for on my behalf (which logically suggests this amount was most likely added to the loan amount to begin with) that I had to pay for. After an uphill battle, I conceded to pay this amount only after verifying that this would settle what I owed for the loan. I was also told that it could take up to 15 days to get a paid off statement. There was no additional conversation regarding any additional termination amount (which would go against their allowance of paying off early with no penalties). A termination loan amount sure sounds like a penalty to me. Fast forward a month now, I just received another email regarding payment and am being told that they charged me twice for the ***** fee and that I still owe over ******* for the difference of terminations fees that was never discussed with me. They are refusing to accept this loan has been paid in full and further went on to inform me that my principle balance payment was applied to the interest first instead of the principle amount which leaves me with more interest to be paid now. Insult to injury, *** (the highest ranking point of contact) informed me that he will not be calling me back, but will instead sent an email. When I asked for his direct number he told me I could just call the customer service line back and ask for him. Doesnt sound like he or GoodLeap are wanting to resolve this issue.

Message: If  I could the rating would be in the negative. In January of 2022, a salesman from Southern Solar **** came to my house stating he could save me money on my electric bill since the weather at that time had caused an uptick in cost. I invited him in and heard how installing solar panels will eliminate my electric bill and cause the value in my home to increase. After he went to his truck and returned to state that I was approved for the installation of the panels, this came insulating my attic and also a brand new generator along with two propane tanks. **** stated the cost would be roughly $33,000 with a monthly payment of $203...well needless to say after one year, I received a call stating that I had not invested enough payment so the monthly payment increased to $273 per month although the account was set up on auto payment. Recently I let my nephew review the contract and documents from off the website. When he printed it out, he noticed a discrepancy on the interest rates. When I first approved the interest rate was at ****% on the documents from off line states the interest rate was well over 6%. Upon further inspection, it looks as though my signature from docusigned was taken from there and placed on the new documents with the higher interest rates.....I never paid 6% for anything due to good credit score...Please please please do not purchase or obtain a loan from this company and once I find a good attorney, I  will see them in court....which they already have a vast amount of suites against them already

Name: Monique C

Message: Goodleap, says 'yes' continuously on recorded line but doesn't follow through. On Oct 17, 23 I've received a new roof on my home. I've qualified with Goodleap for financing the project with the local roofing company and it was perfect timing. By Nov 13 2023 I was able to see that my account has been created on the Goodleap portal, I'm ready to start making payments and knocking this bill out. Contact billing and was informed I'm unable to make payments. I was told by GoodLeap billing representative that my first payment isn't due until Dec 17 2023. I understood that but I was told that once the account was created and you received the email you can start paying your bill, not the case. Here are the things that I discussed for an understanding so I can plan out my payment process: 1. Outside of the regular payments due can I make principal payment to the loan? I was told yes but the regular payment has to be received, any thing extra will be automatically applied to the principal of the loan. 2. Any penalty for paying the loan off sooner than schedule? No 3. How can I make a principal payment to bring down my loan amount? Go online and schedule extra payments and state for principal only. On Dec 17 23 I made my first regular payment of ****** and add **** to see how the principal payment would be applied. The entire amount went towards interest that has be accumulating since Oct 17 23. In Jan24 I've contacted the billing department because the Jan 7th payment went completely towards interests. Every payment I'll make that's principal will be put on interest for the next 5 months before any principal of the loan is deducted, that's ridiculous. There has to be a solution to resolve this so I'm able to start paying the principal and you all 'Goodleap' can get your interest, nope. I've offered to increase my monthly payment so the interest your owed is paid quicker in a bi' weekly fashion or monthly and I can pay down the principal, and received a NO from GoodLeap.

Name: Danielle R

Message:   This is the shadiest loan I have ever had.   Goodleap contacted us to take over the solar loan for our Sunrun panels that just been installed before any payments were made.  All that was communicated to us was that the loan would be shorter, we would receive some money, and that we had no payments due until three months after our panels were operational.    After a couple months of autopayments, I checked the online statements and saw that 100% of all of the previous months of payments went straight to interest.  NONE had gone to principle.  After a phone call to Goodleap, it turns out there was still hundreds of dollars of unpaid interest that we didn't know about and hidden in the agreement was short sentence about charging interest from the origination of the loan and not the date our first payment was due.  This was never communicated to us.   Here's the thing.  You cannot see your current balance anywhere on the website.  You cannot see the current balance on your statements.  You can ONLY see your UNPAID PRINCIPLE balance on your statements.  You cannot see how much interest has been accruing ANYWHERE on the website or statements, you have to call them and ask.  Typically you only have to do this for a payoff amount, but the current amount and the payoff amount are different.  Had we not made an extra payment, all our payments for over 6 months would have gone to interest. They are hoping you don't catch this so you miss your target balance date and they can increase your payments.   Additionally, if you make an extra payment, they will cancel your autopayment for that month without telling you, and you cannot tell them not to.  You cannot see on the website how your payments are allocated, that information is only on the statement.   Lastly, they opened a credit union account in our name without asking, I only found out about it when I got the statement in the mail.  Apparently this is where they will deposit a refund if you made a payment accidentally.

Dont sign up with them or any other solar companies. All you will be doing is throwing away your money.

Name: Guenter W

Message: GoodLeap funded our solar loan. The day after the installation, I called GoodLeap to pay off the loan because I did not want to accrue any interest. I was told that I could not pay off the loan yet because the loan had not yet been activated within GoodLeap's system, and that it would take 3-5 days to become active. I was also told that my loan would not accrue any interest for 3 months, and that I therefore didn't need to worry about the timing for paying off the loan within those 3 months. I took notes documenting the call, including the name of the person I talked to, and e-mailed them to myself. Fast forward 10 weeks. When I want to pay off the loan, I am told that it had been accruing interest all along, and that I owe $500+ in interest. I share that I was told that no interest would accrue, and share my e-mailed notes to myself showing what I was told. The GoodLeap representative says they have no record of my phone call, and can not locate the person I talked to. They show no interest that someone on their staff misinformed me, and that I can credibly corroborate my side of this story.

Then I went online to set up automatic payment, but appeared there was no balance and no minimum payment option! The website has NO WAY to even know your balance! It appears they dont start payments until interest is accruing! I think this is super suspicious!!!!

Message: Flexible lending criteria, high loan approval. Co-borrowers do not have to be on title or live in the property. You can re-amortize your loan multiple times with a $2,500 minimum saving you a ton of interest, or people who cant apply their entire 30% ITC in the first 18 months. Simple loan application and streamline process.    Things to keep in mind, GoodLeap is just the money source for funding solar projects. Typically people that have bad experiences 9 out of 10 times falls back on the installation company. Be sure that you go with the reputable installation company that can get the job done before, your first loan payment is due. Do your research before going with an installer and make sure they can get the job done in a timely manner.

We had an interest free arrangement and failed to realize that if we went beyond that period we would be charged interest for the entire year of the promotion and not just the time moving forward.  As a result, thanks to being one month over the promotional period in paying off the balance, we were changed an additional 10% of our original loan amount!  Again, READ THE FINE PRINT.  The initial "interest free" period is anything but.

Message: DO NOT FINANCE WITH GOODLEAP!!!  Use anyone else. I echo what others have said. I had the 0% interest, and they never contacted me that entire year. I called them to pay in full, and they said the promotional period had ended less than a week prior. This cost me an additional $3,000 to settle the account. The money loss *****, but the sheer disgust for the way I was treated is why I'm here. I was told any contact from goodleap during the promotional period to notify clients it's coming to an end soon was "a courtesy", and they acknowledged never attempting that "courtesy" for me, but did note on my account 3 days after the promotional period ended that they made no attempt to contact. Other "notes" were apparently made, but deception is their game. Financed through ARS Plumbing. I will do no business with ARS (and deter others) until they no longer use goodleap. I will advise all others to do the same. goodleap is a horrible company, only concerned with revenue (and happy to hurt people to get it), so I'll affect their revenue stream best I can. ARS, that's $$$$$$ in jobs I've already referred elsewhere in **************** remodels. More to come. goodleap, ARS isn't your only revenue stream. I'll get to those too. Enjoy that $3k though.

Goodleap started to get payment from my account in FEB 2023. I tried calling them and the company that installed the panels, but no one returned my call. After a month of trying to call, I was told by someone from Goodleap that the company that installed the panels had gone out of business and another company was taking over. I was told that ***** Electric will be completing the job. I tried calling several times, but no one returned my call. Then around April, *************************** called me and said that ***** Electric is working on my solar. However, she could not give me a time line. She was calling me every month to say that ***** is working on it but again, no timeline. In Aug, she stopped updating me. Goodleap is still getting the payment every month. In Sept2023, I placed a stop payment on my account. Collection keeps calling me, and even said that it is not their responsibility if the system was not completed. I have to pay for the panels. I removed the hold. However, in late Oct, I still could not contact *****. In Nov, I placed a hold on the payment. Goodleap only wants the money and do not care if the services was completed as agreed. I still can not talk with *************************** when I call. I had left her messages, but no answer.GOODLEAP IS RIPPING OFF ITS CUSTOMERS. I am capable of paying the loan. I just want them to finish it rather than pay for something that is useless on my roof.

Message: NOT recommended. This is a shady finance company with horrible customer service. I spoke with 4 different people who indicated my claim was being reviewed and then left no notes on the account. I paid my entire balance in full prior to my due date, which was the only date made available on their site. They have systemic processes in place to ensure you believe the due date is the correct date for no interest financing and then when you pay in full you learn the cutoff was much earlier. I paid the full balance and then lost my job. They refused to acknowledge that I paid the full amount borrowed in good faith and instead of showing compassion they led me along for another month. I had to pay an extra 500 dollars to save my credit rating and it literally took my grocery  money. They were aware of this yet continued to string me along until I finally gave in and paid it. If you use this company, call them right away and make them give you a firm date for no interest payoff, otherwise you will be led to belive the due date is different and you will miss the cutoff.

I have a group representing at least twenty families, and growing they all are stuck in loans for services never received by a contractor who misrepresented themself. Goodleap knows but does not care.  The owners of that business disappeared on hundreds of clients. Furthermore, they helped defraud me by changing a docu sign after i signed it, to make sure I stayed in the loan. There were changes to the document after I signed. This is the most illegal and unconscionable business I have ever worked with.

After all was said and done I realized that it was only charging interest for a year and nothing towards principal. Thankfully for me I am able to pay  in full and just did so. The customer service rep was completely unfazed by my hostility, that should tell you something. I could hear others in the background dealing with angry customers. So far the quality of the job is ok but DO NOT finance thru them or at least do a better job reading the contract that I did as the salesman told me many times that it was no interest for a year. I have no doubt this was a deliberate scam.

GoodLeap didn't discuss with us that it was a secured loan and that we would pay fees when we paid off the loan.  Now that I look, I do see that these terms were hidden in the contract, so shame on me for not reading the fine print before I signed the contract.  But shame on them for hiding important features of the loan and charging hidden fees.  It seems pretty unconscionable not to discuss that it was a secured loan.  Nobody likes 'gotcha' moments or surprise fees, so I recommend avoiding this company.

Message: After all the research I've done, please heed my advice - DO NOT GET A LOAN FROM THIS COMPANY. The amount of interest is insane, they paid the loan to my contractor SIX MONTHS before our Solar Panels actually worked and got installed. When calling and asking them about our contract stating that Good Leap WOULDN'T pay until installation was completed - they let me know it was wrong. When I asked the first time when my interest free time was up they told me May **** and when I pushed them to double check because they have been so unreliable, they then told me it was in November 2023. That let's me know they are faulty with information to customers and are taking advantage of people that do not have time to push for information like this. We borrowed against our 401k rather than continue on with Good Leap because of their sketchy and unreliable: business practices, customer services and contracting (that they don't comply with).I cannot tell you enough to NOT go with this company. Extremely high interest, long term loan payments and customer service that will not give you the papers you ask for. This was such a terrible experience that I will be filing with the ******** Attorney General for fraud. Also they committed fraud on my father, who is a Senior Citizen and is Disabled.

I did ALL the steps that was told to me by the GoodLeap representative as far as emailing the information about the buyers of my home was well as the real estate agents information to the assumptions team and as of a week ago I was told that the buyers could not assume my loan for the solar panels and the only way that I could get out of this loan was if I paid the loan in full which is $53,000 and I definitely don't have that type of money to just throw away. GoodLeap has misled me the entire process of trying to get the loan assumed by the buyers of my home by telling me the entire time that the loan could be assumed and just one week ago to just all of a sudden STOP assuming loans completely and not to even accept any new loans for solar panels!!! This is by far the most RIDICULOUS Ponzy scheme that I have been involved with and I feel as if I am being conned out of $53,000. So I am asking for a settlement for the solar panels and you all can even come and get them off of my home because after going through this GOD AWFUL process I wouldnt recommend solar panels to ANYONE especially financing from GoodLeap. GoodLeap has put me in a very bad predicament and I wish that you all would have some sort of sympathy for me and allow me to settle out of the contract gracefully. I havent even had the solar panels installed for 2 months and I havent even made a payment on them as of yet and for you all to come up with this ridiculous rule when I have been in communication with you all for the last past 3 months is very Frustrating and definitely bad business for the GoodLeap team to even allow this to happen to someone!!!

Was a pleasure to work with and made me feel like I mattered and wasn't just a number. Thanks so much for getting it over the finish line for me.

Message: I was told that my loan could be paid off in 198 months, which would be less time than I Have on my current mortgage. I was given a payoff amount of $1100 a month. Now, I'm being told it's $1100 a month for 30 years (360 months). I've explained that I will be retired in 18 years, so this is unacceptable. The gal I spoke with refuses to call me back or do anything to resolve this issue. I'm not going to be moving forward. Thankfully, I'm early enough in to not move forward, but this is ridiculous.

Last month months electric bill was $290 plus $135 loan payment so that is hardly the great savings the salesman told us we could look forward to! Maybe they should come out and add additional panels at their cost. It mustve felt very good to ******* an army veteran like they did    Shame on this company.

When I asked why;  they said only the panels were on the contract and they got installed so they released the money.  But there was no Inverter or fuse panel upgrade to 200amp.  They said they would follow up and help if *** did not follow through. Install finally got done in April after lots of pestering but system still did not work.   *** finally came out in July and did some work but again left without the system working.  ******** was now sending a txt message here and there asking for an update from me but ******** would only respond with *** said they would get back to me.  Any loan they paid ASA after April that was not completed is on them.  Check your installers and check out the loan company to be sure their policies are not to pay until you approve the installation is complete.

Message: Do not do business with GoodLeap.  I had a solar company come to install the solar panels in 2021, GoodLeap said in their contract that they would not start payments until the solar panels were installed.  The company came to install the solar panels, dug up my yard, turned off my electricity, and then said they would come back the next day.  They came back, turned on my electricity, and said they were having trouble with the installation because the city wanted a different design.  GoodLeap called and asked if my panels were installed, I said no, and they said they would get with the installer and have them up and working, but they were going to start the payment process.  The next month they started me making payments, the solar company said they would finish the job and get me up and running.  This was August 2021, they went out of business in January 2023, and GoodLeap knew they were going out of business and told me they would take care of it.  Now GoodLeap says there is nothing they can do and that I have to keep paying for the loan.  I repeat, do not do business with GoodLeap, you will end up paying for something you never get to use.

Name: Matt M

Message: Had a new AC installed into my house and unfortunately the installing company finances through Goodleap. I set up auto-pay so I would never be late on a payment. After my first payment went through I contacted customer service and requested a due date change, which they obliged. I then saw on my account that I would owe the regular payment on the orginal payment date (26th) and then the following month I would owe double that on the new payment date (2nd). I contacted customer service and they said not to worry about anything as long as auto-pay is set up. They said the double charge is there because they are going to skip the 26th payment. Here I am 2 days after the 26th payment and I am getting calls from Goodleap saying I am late on my payment...even though I scheduled everything through them and was told it would be fine. So, less than 3 payments into this loan and I will be taking a better loan out with my bank and paying this clusterf off as soon as possible!!!

When I explained I am not an LLC, but instead an ****  they shot over a email that they don't lend to any investors.  BUYERS of solar BE VERY AWARE.  You can not just release your liability to another purchaser of your home, and you MAY BE required to pay off an enormous debt to sell your home, whether you are selling by choice or forced to sell because of tragic circumstances.... ************ should be blacklisted and bankrupted.

Message: I hired PRO BUSINESS SOLUTIONS to install solar panels 9/2022.  I found out through Goodleap the finance company that *** had closed its doors 3/2023.  *** only needed the final inspection from the city to turn us on with the electric company but they never completed the project.  Goodleap said they were going to hire another solar company to finish the work.  Goodleap said the new solar company they hired should contact me within a few weeks to setup a date to begin the work. Well its 9/15/2023 and I have not heard a word from the new company.  I have contacted Goodleap serveral times  advising that no one answers or returns calls from this new solar company.  I have asked for updates from the Goodleap's rep that was helping me and she no longer helps.  I asked Goodleap to stop the payment charges until the company finishes  with the installation at no interest added to my loan until they complete the project.  I inquired from Goodleap if they had paid out  *** for the work and they said the loan did not fund. so that means they did not pay *** for the work that was done yet i am stuck not only paying them but also the electric company.  I want them to stop the payment process until the work is complete without adding interest to the end of my loan.  These loan companies should be regulated so that they don't pay out loans on work that has not been completed especially solar panels. These  solar contractors end up with the money, close their companies and we end up stuck with the bill fighting the lender.  The ******************* is promoting solar they should regulate the process. I need a resolution because I can't not continue to pay a double bill one with Goodleap and the other with the electric company.  I was supposed to save money.

You have to call to get any information (like did my bank make the payment?). I am glad I called today. So I set up auto payment months ago. The lady helped me figure out how much each payment needed to be before the end of promotional period. When I asked the question today if it would be paid off before end of promotional payment she told me I would have a .01 cent balance. So if I did not check and the promotional period left me with a balance of a ***** I would be obligated to pay almost 16% interest for the entire amount for the entire promotional balance. This company is horrible. ***** Fargo is much better but if you have to use Goodleap make sure you pay attention or they will get you. Good luck!!

Message: My stepmother passed away in May 2023 at the age of 82.  She was told by ************** (2 years ago) that the solar panels were FREE!  She told anyone who asked that she got the panels for free and that she had no electric bills.   After her passing, I found out that GoodLeap was being paid $300/mo for the past two years and that her solar panels were, in fact, NOT FREE. Rather, the salesman and GoodLeap sold $60K worth (which should have been more like $20K) to an 80-year old who thought she was getting them for FREE.   Additionally, they had her finance the panels for 25 years (I guess they expected her to live to be really old).  The signatures on the loan were electronically submitted, so I really DOUBT that she signed the loan agreement.  I feel like GoodLeap KNEW (or should have known) they were EXPLOITING the elderly.   There should be a law against such transactions and GoodLeap should NOT be allowed to be in business. SHAME on you!   **************, by the way, does not return calls and their office is now vacant.  There is also a notice on their front door (******** office) that they failed to pay rent.

Dont they keep a copy??) & the borrower auth form & purpose of request. I did so last Tues. Requested a delivery & read receipt. Delivery receipt confirmed. No read receipt. Called back on Fri. Got billing ***** Was told to resend, as maybe it got lost. No, the billing **** (who I was talking to) couldnt verify if the email had been recd. Ok then - can you give me the phone # for the right ****? No - we send an email to reach them. Asked for a supervisor. Told me they couldnt help me either so no point in putting me thru to one. Told me again to resend the email. & send it to billing **** too so she could personally get it & send to filings (people who didnt respond to my 1st email). Uh-huh. Youve a way to reach in & grab my 1 email to a generic email address & personally handle it. I hung up. We will see if they do their jobs before the closing date on my loan. Not holding my breath. Not the fault of the people Im talking to. Is the fault of the execs who design a crappy system that give customers zero recourse when things go wrong & they need to talk to someone.

Message: Goodleap and ***** Solar are a total fraud. ***** Solar salesperson came to my home and promised all sorts of goods and lied to me. 1 of the lies was after we paid off the solar panels, we were not going to have anymore light bills. The second lie was not only were we going to get solar panels installed but also have a generator and water filtration system installed as well. All of this took place last year and the solar panels don't work, no generator or water filtration system but Goodleap is still charging me. And to be honest I'm not going to pay for something that doesn't work. I have told them to go and take the solar panels off the roof. They can have them. Goodleap is charging me $79,000 for equipment that is valued at $30,000. I called two different solar companies and according to the equipment thats installed on the roof, its no more than $30,000. Plus I didn't sign the contract, my wife did but she doesn't speak, read or write English. The contract is under her name. The salesperson told my wife what the contract said but under his circumstances. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I have told Goodleap to take back the solar panels off the roof, we don't want them because of the lies and them not working.

Whomever I dealt with (e.g., Senior Mortgage Specialist *********************** and Senior Loan Processor *********************************), they were both "fantastic."

Claiming SRP would buy the energy from me, which would pay the loan.  Crystal ******* qualified me for a $53,000 loan from(scam #2) Goodleap (Did I mention Im on Social Security ) I should never have been able to qualify.. and last but not least (scam #3)  Titan the installer .  Titan solar power does not accept any responsibility partnering with Crystal ******* or Goodleap.  Titan did install solar panels in a shaded place that prevents the panels to work at their best . ***** refused to right their wrong without payment.

I have had Solar Panels since October 2022 and I cannot even use them because they and their partners dropped the ball big time! The solar panel installation company filed bankruptcy. Hence, my job is left incomplete. When I contacted them, they said that the company had been too small to help its borrowers out. Meaning that they gave away my money before the job was even complete, to a company filing bankruptcy, and said they would only help finish the job they are involved in if the company was bigger and had more clients. You are quick to take my money and ask for it back, but have terrible customer service and don't seem to take any responsibility for your clients financial well being.

Message: I need it to replace my AC on 08/2022. The first due date was 04/2024. while waiting they said I can make a payment to reduce the amount so on the due date I will start paying what I owe after I made some payments. I did make some payments but when I go to the website to check my statement I see zeros only not my current balance the only information available is the due date 04/2024. I had to get a copy of my credit report one time and I got shocked when I saw that I amount of the loan had increased by $290 instead of decreasing after I made payments. When I called their customer service they said yes the payments start on 04/24 but we charge you an interest rate. and If I can pay off the loan before the due date they will only charge me the original amount. When I said that it was not explained to me this way when I got the loan he said yes it was on page 5 paragraph 9 line 7 in the agreement document. I asked to talk to a supervisor but I was put on the line for 30 minutes with no one answering the phone. Sadly! I see other reviews from customers complaining about the same issue but no actions were taken. This is really a bad business. I do not recommend this company.

I PAID IN FULL ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT.  The supervisor is now trying to tell me that I didn't call them for a "payoff". Excuse me!!!!! When you have a statement amount on a NO INTEREST FOR 6 MONTHS LOAN AND YOU PAY IT OFF EARLY, SINCE WHEN DO YOU NEED TO CALL FOR A PAYOFF!!!!!!! Ridiculous. I don't owe this extra fee!

Message: Terrible service and the people working customer service are just as incompetent. We used them to help pay for an unexpected repair and upon paying off the loan were told we still owed because we did not request the full loan payout. They have called my phone looking for my husband every single time despite having his phone listed on the account and when I attempt to solve the issue, I am told I am not authorized to manage the account. When I ask why they are calling his wife I am told they have my number listed as a good contact number despite his number being listed on the account with his name next to it. We thought we paid off the remaining principal and yet I have just received another call telling me we owe .06 because the payment for the payoff was sent back. How do you send back a over the phone payment, and if it was unauthorized or denied why was that not stated over the phone when the payment was made. They keep terrible records and notes of phone conversations which is ironic since your supposedly on a recorded line. I'm told at this point we have resolved our account, I have requested records of all payments including the one from today and we shall see if they actually paid off the account or if they keep acting like monkeys run their business.

I called the number on the email, and they were the rudest and nonhelpful. I was unaware that a loan was put in my name without my signature; I was not home and did not sign anything for a loan to be in my name. I spoke to the owner, and he was not helpful at all. They have ruined my credit, and I am pursuing to take them to court for fraud, stealing my social security number, and filing a loan under my name without my permission, authority, or approval. I have worked so hard to earn my credit for a company to steal and file a loan using my name. I am confident that the courts will find a resolution to STOP this from happening to someone else and running their credit score.

Whether you want to pay your loan off quickly and have a higher payment, or stretch it out for a longer period and have a lower payment, GoodLeap has different rates in each category. They also give a quick approval or denial so you can let your customer know right away. As a Solar professional, these are all wonderful options to have! Thank you GoodLeap!

Message: Absolutely do not get solar financing. If you must finance, ONLY do a heloc or line of credit because at least then you'll have control on paying the installers for completed work. Goodleap pays in full automatically regardless of the status of your install. So if you never had a problem with Goodleap, count yourself lucky. Goodleap sets you up with a loan, and then will pay the installer automatically in full WITHOUT verifying that the system is installed and working. I am now on month 5 of payments (because otherwise my credit is dinged) for an incomplete system, and all Goodleap can do is **** off my contract to another 2 star installer, who btw Goodleap dumped like ******* incomplete contracts at once. So jokes on me on when my contract will actually be fixed all the while I am paying. DO NOT GET SOLAR FINANCING, FINANCE IT WITH A HELOC. GOODLEAP RELEASES  YOUR MONEY WITHOUT CHECKING EVERYTHING IS WORKING AND DOES NOT CARE.

We have asked every month since dealing with these people to set up both accounts for automatic withdrawal so that proper bills come out at a time and every month they supposedly help set it up. Now we've started getting harassed by their employees if the payment is 3 days late because they didn't help on their end. I got a call from one that absolutely argued with me while I was trying to get off the phone at work and had a complete attitude when I was trying to explain I'd go and have her call back. This is unacceptable from any company to act like some kind of loan shark gangster asking for money when it could have been handled in a proper manner. Do NOT use these people for anything.

Every month for over 4 years i either wrote, called, or sometimes both to ask, plead, demand that my bill be mailed so that i could receive it prior to the due date.  Butevery month the bill arrived either on or, most often, after the due date.  Of course, this negatively affected my credit score, which made no difference to the company.  I was told that the bills were mailed on the 12th of each month and the due date was the 3rd of the following month. The *********** assured me that it indeed does not take 3 weeks for mail to be delivered.  **************** always refused to connect my call or give me the contact number for the billing department.   So i scrimped and saved and paid off the 15 year loan in a little over 4 years.  The final bill arrived on February 5th. (The due date was February 3rd).  I wrote l large check for the entire amount.  I PAID THE LOAN OFF IN FULL!  For the last 2 months i have received more bills from this company.

Name: Michael H

Message: It's been an absolute nightmare dealing with GoodLeap and the company, that is now bankrupt, that installed my solar panels last year. In February this year, I received a call from GoodLeap saying that they were going to help me find another solar company to finish the installation process. Every time I have called since then, I've been given the runaround, and the representative would not allow me to speak to a supervisor who supposedly was the one who knew what was going on. Finally, today (April 25) I received a call and was told that my system was approved for operation in January. Then, I was told to call another solar company who was supposed to be assigned to activate the system. When I called, I wasn't even in their system. When I called the representative from GoodLeap again, she told me that since it was "approved", she wouldn't be able to help me further because "it wasn't in my contract". So if it passed inspection in January, why was it not activated then and why did they call me a month later if they can't help? Now I'm stuck paying for panels that *** or *** not actually be operational, and GoodLeap is still reluctant to help. I would recommend staying far away from this company, at any cost. They always say "we just financed the panels", but why would they knowingly finance solar panels knowing very well that the installer was going out of business and didn't finish the job? I'm paying for something that is probably not even working. That's pretty much the definition of a scam.

Multiple calls to customer service requesting a refund ... it was acknowledged that an overpayment was received ... HOWEVER, I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT 30 DAYS TO HAVE THE REFUND ISSUED.  I kept asking why I had to wait, I was informed that was the "policy".  I sent an email with documentation of everything and asked that a supervisor call me or email me.  Never heard back.  Called customer service and asked to speak with a supervisor.  Supervisor kept saying there was nothing that could be done, I would have to wait for a check to be mailed.  What!?! The customer service representatives I have previously spoken with, said my checking account would be credited back.  Now the supervisor says a check would be mailed.  That would only prolong me receiving the refund.  I asked the supervisor to email me this information so I would have it in writing.  She confirmed my email address and my mailing address.  I never received anything from the supervisor even though she said she would do it right away.  HORRIBLE COMPANY

Message: Goodleap was the finance company for the solar company Powerhome Solar later known as ************  That company is now out of business after scamming thousands of families across the country out of TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS!  Even after knowing about the scam their business partner was doing they continued to finance through them and fund the scam.  Not 1 time did I talk to a representative from Goodleap,  they empowered this company that they knew were scamming families to mislead, deceive, and flat out lie to their customers to get them to sign the documents they needed to steal money from families.  Now they are pushing what I am calling solar scam 2.0.  They are sending out emails telling customers of *************************** that they can suspend payments while they investigate the problems with their systems.  However when you call to take advantage of this offer,  it is not suspending the payments it is deferring the payments.  That means they will still be accruing interest while you aren't making payments.  This is just a scam to get customers that are already under severe financial hardship from the original scam to have to pay even more.

Message: We got a new A/C at the end of October/ beginning of November. Goodleap is our loan servicer. I set up the account as instructed by the sales representative of the A/C company who said I would be charged on a day of my choosing after I set up the accoun. First payment due t 3 months from the date of purchase.I have been charged 3 times this month. This is my first month paying. I contacted their support team 2x. No real explanation was given about why the last charge occurred. When I set up the account the month before the first payment was due, I carefully selected the day to make sure it would not affect my other bills. However, because *** been charged 3x and sent into overdraft, it has created a negative bitterly affect on my finances. I never approved the last charge! Had the company honored the date I selected when I set up the account, I would be in a great place right now. To top it off, Lean (the patient Indian call center lady) said I would have to wait **** business days to see it reflected as a payment for February. Ive NEVER heard of a company doing any of this before. I suspect fraud and would like their business practices reviewed.

Name: Rachel K

Message: If I could get 0 stars, I would. I have been paying for my solar panels plus roof repair using GoodLeap since the summer of 2021. I have always paid my payment early plus for several months I have been trying to pay extra in order to bring down the balance. The balance does not change. When I talk to customer service they said that I need to pay the balance on the exact date and it will give me the option to add extra towards the principal. I have tried several times and several ways, such as paying the payment plus extra in one payment or paying two separate payments and there is no option to add towards the balance. For one year and a half, my statements do not show any decrease in my balance. Even though I pay extra, my interest and monthly payments are now starting to go up. I asked for an amortization schedule from customer service and they said that my statements are online. The online statement is completely vague and does not show any transparency regarding the amortization of my principal and interest. I do not recommend financing with this company. Their customer representatives do not appear to offer any assistance, guidance, or have actual knowledge regarding the company's financial structures. I obtained the loan through LoanPal via SunPro but was then told they changed to GoodLeap after everything was finalized. I am concerned that all three companies were fraudulent and deceitful regarding what they offered versus what I received.

Message: This loan company is shady. Don&rsquo;t do business with them!! The end of 10/2022 we contracted with Ocean Exteriors to have the exterior of the house painted. At that time through Ocean we signed up for a loan with Goodleap for the amount of about $21000. The loan was entered in Goodleap system on 11/2/22 with $0.00 due and $0.00 fee. We quickly paid off the full amount on 11/5/22 but to our surprise Goodleap sent a statement dated 12/2/22 saying we owe $97.00 interest/principal plus $98.00 fee. What I don&rsquo;t get is how they could charge all the fees when the loan was already paid off AND when the first statement was clearly stated way after the loan was paid off. There was no balance for them to go off by. If they charge a cancellation fee then be it but making customers pay for interest/principal where there is none is just wrong. AVOID Goodleap and Ocean. They clearly just want to rear you in without proper explanation. If we knew this would happen we would not sign up. Lesson learned!!!!

Message: Needed new A/C so went to Lowe's. They subcontract Unique Services which offered a 18-month interest free loan for $19,500 through GoodLeap (then 15.99%). Signed contract (11.14.22) and included autopay info for monthly payments. Could not set up and sign on to my GoodLeap account until 17-days after signing loan documents (12.1.22). Lowe's bill paid by unknown Visa (11.28.22). Online act has auto payments starting after interest free period. Manage autopay on site does not permit you to change start date of auto payments. It does allow you to cancel it. Canceled it to create a new auto payment. It then only allows you to pay balance. You can manually schedule payments. Had to separately enter the details to schedule 12 payments; it does not allow you to schedule beyond one year (will need to remember to schedule remaining payments). It is blatant that this company does not want people to make payments during the interest free period. It looks like GoodLeap paid the Lowe's bill by Visa not cash, what loan company does that? I would have been better off applying for and benefitting from a 0% introductory Credit Card that offered points. In the heat of a broken A/C, I regrettably trusted the Rep sent by Unique Service, referred by Lowe's and did not consider other options. Had I had access to my account early on, seeing how GoodLeap functions, I would have paid the Lowe's bill myself and canceled the loan. I wonder if the delay in online access is on purpose.

We were verbally told when signing the paperwork (because it was easier for them to do a run down of what we were signing since they were right there face to face) that our home would not in anyway be attached to these panels. Turns out they took a lien out on our home. They drilled holes in our roof that they didnt even use, messing up the metal, we filed a complaint and still have yet to hear back from the department that supposedly comes out and fixes any damages. We were not told about the buy back program or that our electric company did not offer a buy back program so now we are having to switch over. Our solar panels were installed but not hooked up for the first two months and they were already trying to pull funds out of our account for a service we werent even receiving yet.

I'm a customer that has a loan and they listed me as a creditor because they owe me $7,000. I spent $81,000.00 that Goodleap paid PE way before installation. I tried to cancel this loan before install and they wouldn't let me because it was alreqdy paid to PE. I have a balloon payment in 18 months to come up with 26% of my loan or payment will go up. Hmmmm....coincidence that it's the same percentage that PE stated we would get back in taxes? Yea, I think not. I pay $800-$1000 a month now between my loan and my electricity because it doesnt work.

Message: Predatory loan! You will not get a breakdown of what makes up your loan because they add in fees for giving you the loan because they are working with the solar companies. We paid $75K for 21 solar panels that show no broken down cost. This is because they charge you a dealer fee for giving you the loan, that they don't tell you about and show a low interest rate to get you to sign. They pay out the loan to the solar companies BEFORE they are even installed and running. I had to pay a loan payment and a power bill BEFORE my install was even complete. I asked if they could delay the loan until the install was complete and they refused, stating that had nothing to do with them. Once the solar company filed bankruptcy and went out of business, they again stated there's nothing they can do. My loan is 25 to 30 % higher than the actual cost of the system I bought. I am screwed!

Message: My father contracted to install solar panels on December 2019. Never once did he fall behind on payments, until his death on May 6th 2022. Ever since, Goodleap has been sending harassing and threatening emails and letters, despite my telling their employees that we are in the beginning of probate and we intend to pay them. They also disconnected the solar panels and are now threatening to remove them as well. I have repeatedly contacted them to make them aware of the issue of my father's death, and yet they still continue to make threats. I am also legally disabled and living in the house until we are allowed by the courts to sell it, and dealing with Goodleap and their me first attitude has been super stressful during an already stressful time.

Now install company has closed and after being told by GoodLeap that they cant cancel their contract unless install company cancelled theirs. Now she back tracks and says they cant cancel but will have a project manager reach out to finish getting this system up and running. I think not! Ive been requesting this for the last several months and just been passed around and no reasonable resolution.

We then contracted with *********** to have solar installed on August 8 through 10, 2022. We have had one issue after another with this company from the start. I had to make several phone calls to have the issues resolved, then only to find out they went out of business and filed for Bankruptcy, with no warning to us.  ***********, violated the agreement and breached our contract with us. This contract SHOULD be cancelled since they are no longer a company. The installation was not completed and will not be completed. There is no solar agreement to finance. This leaves us with no Company to back us if we should have any future issues as well. With no further delay, we ask that this loan be cancelled, effective immediately, due to *********** going out of business and defaulting/breaching their contract with us.We have spoken with the loan servicing department keeps sending me to the relations department they replied that they will try to find another solar company. This is not an option for us due to us performing extensive research prior to our decision of going with ***********.  We refuse to rely on another solar company to complete the solar work with the equipment of another company, which will result in us being responsible for any associated fees with an alternate solar company.I have been informed by a reliable source that Goodleap DID NOT pay *********** for the work.  We have inspections remaining and unfinished work. I want answers now!

Message: This was a terrible idea.  Yes, for my solar loan payment they allow you to adjust your payment with the first year to use your tax rebate, if you get one.  They provide late statements every months that you can't open because they are loaded incorrectly ( after a few days of being posted it gets magically fixed ) and only provide them online.  They called all the time in the beginning because they want you to combine your home loan with them which is a terrible idea.  They are very hard to  work with and paying off the loan, that they advertise as easy, is even harder even with the tax rebate percentage deal.  It is hard when excited with a ****** purchase to read the find print, but maybe read it more carefully.  I would recommend a local bank ect. instead.

Message: GOODLEAP AND MC Solar was the WORSE mistake to try to go with. I don't qualify for the tax credit and they took advantage of me by knocking on my door one day. They lied and said I could cancel as they did not give me all the panels they promised and RUSH to install without even speaking to my electric company or helping me get the property liability insurance that I need to get turned on. Be very careful as they don't even have a real office or warehouse, they like to DROP SHIP solar onto your driveway and get wet. They HIRE 3RD PARTIES to install solar and that is probably why they don't have their own warehouse. I cancelled my loan and my solar project before they could ever install and they STILL TOOK THE MONEY from the solar bank and a month later, I get a bill from GOODLEAP. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. My brother is an attorney and I am also contacting my CONGRESSMAN to put a stop to the way they do business.

Message: They are basically loan sharking.  I make extra payments like I ALWAYS HAD with ANY loan.   I expected them to go to the principle and even with the extra payments they blow me off and say this is an INTEREST First loan.   I have been in complete agreement with the amount they deduct directly from my bank account...no problem but I have always made extra payments to go to the Principle to cut down the INTEREST on the principle.   They take all the extra payments and they cut out a few pennies for the regular payment.  This way the promised low interest over the years TURNS INTO AN OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH-INTEREST RATE.   They talk to me like I am stupid...well, I agree...because I am almost blind (80) and I TRUSTED them to be NORMAL loan rate, and like my CAR and HOME LOAN to allow me to pay the PRINCIPLE DOWN with extra payments. They are horrible with their customer service and in essence, just say TOUGH **** IT UP.   You agreed to an INTEREST FIRST PAYMENT.   At this rate, I will die before I get these SOLAR PANELS PAID OFF.  As soon as I can I WILL GET THE LOW-INTEREST RATE that I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING.   This is a complete ripoff. It is horrible for a SENIOR (80) who wants to pay off all my debt. I trusted them as an honorable loan company and not loan sharking.   It is like the loan sharks that run all the low-life used car or check cashing companies.  With a VERY HIGH CREDIT RATING, I have never used this kind of company...and I blame TITAN SOLAR as well.   They should have cared more than to put a person, any person with such a "deal".   And the Government for allowing it.  Even a number of Sec. of States are going after them...they are starting cases against them.  They are usurous.  NOT by the misleading ****% RATE but if they stretch it out with the INTEREST FIRST...unless you pay the whole thing off....their INTEREST FIRST...makes it usurous.  I am so angry with myself for not reading every word of their agreement...INTEREST FIRST and they STICK TO IT.

They don't keep accurate payment records, as my bank statement shows I paid more than what Good Leap shows I've paid. They don't allow you to change your monthly payment (they force you to pay the minimum via EFT). If you want to pay more on your loan they only allow you to do it by submitting an additional payment (which I have to do EVERY month!). This company is horrible and their online platform is not user friendly. If at all possible, avoid them.

I asked for her supervisor and was told she had none.Do not use this company they do not work for you the person paying the bills apparently they work for the solar company.Not even taking the time to inquire if the panels are up. They do not care if it is functional only if you have panels on your roof.I have had solar in the past and the fiance company worked for me because I would be the person paying the **** beware.Disabled vets especially beware our incomes are are limited.

Message: Goodleap has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My mother's home had solar panels under a loan from them and after sale of the home, a few payments of the loan were made (that they said we had to make) before the new home owner took over the loan. They assured us that we would be reimbursed for these extra payments. It has been 8 months and 12 phone calls later, and they keep saying the check will be mailed in **** business days. Every time I ask to speak to a supervisor, they say there is no supervisor available, but one will call me back. No one ever calls back. This has happened three times. These people essentially have stolen our money. No one should do business with this company -- they are not professional, and keeping a customer's money for 8 months is unlawful. They provide no reason why the check has not been mailed. They only say that they will send an email to their accounting department. My recommendation is that anyone stay away from this company.

Message: If I could, I would give them a ZERO star. They are so unprofessional, customer service is the worst. We assumed a loan along with a lot of stress, since they are not willing to honor what a GoodLeap Billing representative stated. I've sent a few emails, called so many times and yet, I am still waiting to get a hold of a billing manager. I've asked that they review my conversation with their representative, yet I am still waiting to hear from them regarding this request. A representative told me that my FIRST Payment was due in July, yet we started to receive collection calls in June, that's when I knew something was wrong. I've try so many times to escalate this issue, however, the contact list is limited and unable to reach headquarters to escalate this matter to upper management. I didn't do my homework and research this company prior to accepting this loan at the time of purchasing our home. Now that we are in this situation, I've come across reviews with similar experiences. Not sure how a company can ignore the problem they have, they should address it so they can be better and have happy customers. Seems like all they have is frustrated customers and it's very unfair, when they want you to sign, they will say what you need to hear to persuade you to sign, but when is time to put what they say in place, they say, there was a miscommunication, well that explains why GoodLeap Representative will not put any request in writing, they don't want to be hold accountable for misleading a customer. Just wish they would be more caring and help the customers when they need help.

A couple days ago I paid in full only to find out there was in fact an extra $102.00 termination fee. It's not the $102.00 I have a problem with, everyone has to make a profit, It's the fact they told me up front there would be no fees which was obviously a lie. Don't like being lied to. When I asked to speak with a manager the person put me on hold for 15 minutes and came back with the same song and dance and never got to speak with a manger.

Message: Solar Panel Sales- Buyer Beware! There's a salesman that has signed up many homeowners in my area for GoodLeap home loan and installation with MC Solar. Everything sounded great until I read the 30 page contract that I signed, way too quickly. According to the contract I need $1million dollars in liability coverage every year which costs $600 extra and if I miss payments, they don't put a lien on the house, they take it. It's called a "security interest". Not to mention I could get solar for about $10,000 cheaper elsewhere. Please don't sign anything ever without reading the contract first, having a lawyer review it. We had to send a telegram. I didn't even know they were still a thing, but once you send a telegram it's legally binding to cancel the contract. This has cost us around $100 to register mail and send the telegram.

Good Leap LLC has lost $21,300 that they haven't found in 4 months. They don't seem to care that the money that funded was never used to pay off my Good Leap Solar loan. No one will contact me. They have known about the situation for months. So, lost or stolen funds seems to be acceptable business practice for this company. Meanwhile,  I am out $21,300 for what seems like forever more. Good Leap LLC has offered no relief and no explanation.

Message: GoodLeap is an absolutely horrible company! GoodLeap is the loan for our solar panels that wasnt operational for approximately 3 months after they started demanding payment. GoodLeap altered the contract and illegally obtained banking information to sign up for auto pay, which we removed autopay afterwards. GoodLeap customer service is excessively unprofessional and call on a daily basis. When payment was sent directly from our bank to GoodLeap they refused to provide proof of receipt for approximately ***** days. The only way to receive a receipt of this type of payment is on billing statement, which at that time we have discovered that they refuse to apply the payment to the principal of the loan. When the company was confronted about applying the payment to the balance they claimed the payment was applied to interest, which on the statement the company doesnt disclose interest charges. You will also receive daily phone calls from this company of threats of collections even if you are not paid on the date it is due. They demand using autopay constantly.  Their online account is also absolute garbage and is practically only to view statements and auto pay. After a lot of research on this company there is multiple lawsuits against them. If you can get out of using GoodLeap do so immediately and keep a significant eye on your previous payments to ensure they were applied correctly to your balance.

Message: GoodLeap is a terrible company that takes customer money and does not complete their solar commitments per their signed contracts, and stops communicating with their clients when this is pointed out. They used a substandard solar company to finish our solar installation, which caused damage to our system and did not adhere to permit timeframes and did not pay their fees. Thus our city has reached out to us, the customer, with sanctions and fees that, per our signed contract, is the responsibility of GoodLeap to pay and manage in a timely fashion. This project which was estimated at 3-4month timeframe tops, has now been an ongoing issue for ********. We have reached out many times a week over months, only to have our emails and phone calls ignored. They have tried to charge us our loan fees during this time, but per our signed contract, we are only liable for payments once the system is turned on and active on the grid, which it is not. They are a shame company with substandard business practices and pray on environmentally conscious clients, in an effort to take their money and not complete the work they agreed to in the signed contracts.

I could go to a loan shark and get a better rate. with points of 3 and payoff of fifteen years.  I am sure that they can explain the reasoning behind the final payout being this high and still say that the rate is 1.9 %. I say hiding behind fake numbers for large profit is profoundly wrong and every person associated with knowing that the payouts to the money barrowed is this high should go to H*** when they die to experience the 1.9 % of the heat that is expressly 100% worse.

After giving up on the process and choosing to refinance with another lender, I finally was listed as loan holder. Still chose to refinance. Have been requesting a Verification of Mortgage document from Goodleap for 6 weeks. Phone calls always get routed to the solar panel division. Hold times for the home loan number are 15 to 40 minutes. No consistent status on loan, every call has the process at a different point, never the same. No information about the steps in the process. How many steps are there? What step have I reached? Why am I told a work order has been implemented for my request, that it will take anywhere from 48 hours to 10 business days, but it NEVER happens? February request for VOM was 10 business days.. subsequent request were 48 hours.. 5 requests in all...6 weeks in total... document has NEVER been sent.

Name: Jeffrey Q

Message: Buyer Beware!I was contracting a solar install project for my home that was to be financed through GoodLeap, Everything was going well and as planned and I received the lending documents to sign digitally. After confirming the details, I proceeded with signing the lending documents and sent them back. Within a few hours, GoodLeap voided the lending contract and sent me a new contract citing that there was updated information (but did NOT state what had changed in the contract!) Upon review of the new contract, it was clear that GoodLeap had raised the interest rate and monthly payments. After contacting both my dealer and GoodLeap, an answer was given that this was a computer algorithm mistake that should not have happened. They corrected the error and sent me new documents to sign. Had I not done my due diligence and thoroughly reviewed the documents before signing, I would have locked myself into a contract with a higher rate than I was pitched and with no legal fix.The new documents sent to me contained the same error...higher interest rate than I was sold. Again, this was corrected and again, they sent new documents. This time, with the correct documents in hand, I refused to sign the Binding Arbitration clause and called GoodLeap to have the clause removed. After passing me around a few times to different customer service agents, I was eventually told that they are not allowed to make changes to the contracts. Funny, that didn't seem to be the case when they changed my interest rate...twice. After some discussion, it became clear that GoodLeap was engaged in underhanded and predatory lending practices and utilized a Binding Arbitration clause to protect themselves. I immediately cancelled my lending contract and cancelled my solar install project.Buyer, please beware of predatory lending practices from this financial institution!

Because of his sacrifice she was able to purchase a home which that is being swindled from her because of a installation tech named *********************. My mother in law have her daughter handle all of her business except this time. The tech convienously volunteered his self and services to make the sale of a $100,000.00 25 year contract. He installed a water filtering system and a solar panel system on her home. My mother in law have an analog phone and she used my wife's email since she handles all her business, she doesn't have a computer nor any way to do DocuSign any thing. The tech created an email address for her, and signed the documents for her digitally. She called my wife crying because she received a contract in the mail for $100,000.00 and they were drafting her bank account. My wife called the company to try and get her out of the contract but was brushed off.Her light **** is a little over $450.00 for a few months, they **** her $238.00, Her light **** now is about a $160.00 Once her visitors is out of her house her **** will go back to $140.00 or lower She can control her energy consumption but she is trapped into This long contract and if she default or die they are going to take her home? She feel that the company is heartless and evel thieves. She says if she would have understood the term and final cost she wouldn't never done it. She says all she was hearing is that her light **** will go down and how healthy her water would be. She says she wanted a ********* Suburban but didn't buy one because $80,000.00 was too much, so why would I get into an contract like that.

We were told the loan was not assumable by an LLC, which is who purchased the house.  So the entire amount of the loan, $35,000, came off the proceeds of the sale. After the sale of the home,  they are still withdrawing his monthly payment, even though the loan has been paid off.  I have sent over my POA two times and yet they say "their system isn't updated."  The entire experience with this organization, as well as the solar company has been a nightmare!

Message: I financed my A/C & furnace install through goodleap. I went to make a full payment on my entire principle balance. Instead of paying off my loan, goodleap decided to subtract an additional interest payment. They then left a balance and subsequent interest payment on my account. No where in the contract or payment portal does it mention that you must contact them to make a payoff of the loan. After spending over an hour they finally told me you must request a "payoff statement" in order to pay off your loan. BE ADVISED they "require" a wire payment or paycheck. This company is very fraudulent with this practice.

Message: When I signed the loan agreement I was given a 2 month grace ******* No payments for 60 days after funds were provided to the contractor. The installer placed the panels on the roof and told the loan company the job was complete.  The loan company released the funds. I was told by the installer that an electric panel upgrade was needed and it was scheduled for 6 weeks after the panels were placed on the roof.  When I contacted the loan company I was told that it was their policy to release the funds the day the installer informed them the panels were placed on the roof. I am sitting here without solar power while interest accrues on the loan, I feel that I have been robbed of my 60 day grace ****** by collusion between the loan company and the installer.  If I hire a contractor to build me a patio he will not get paid in full until the job is finished. I feel that the funds should have been withheld until the installation was complete. Panel  upgrade is scheduled for March 30, 2022. I was notified that first payment is due April 22, 2022. Can anybody tell me what happened to my 60 day grace ******?

I tell them every single time, they clearly never take notes because the 1st time, 5th time, 20th time, it's like it's a surprise to them to hear it! A good portion of the reviews on here look fake as can be. Go look at Trustpilot, nothing but 1 star reviews!

Then they said they could cancel it, since it was still pending. Told me it was cancelled, it wouldnt come out of my account. They never did cancel it. It came out of my account, and wiped out all the overtime my husband worked as prices for groceries and diapers soar. I have kids to feed.

Message: GoodLeap formerly Loanpal is the worst lender I have dealt with in my 30+ years on dealing with lenders. If available I would give them 0 stars.  I have a solar panel system loan. The web access has very little information and functionality to get information regarding your loan.  They don't respond to questions or provide details of interest charges.  I finally got details of the interest charges and found my interest per day increased while my principal balance decreased.  Avoid them as a Lender at all cost even to the point of paying a slightly higher interest rate.

I havent even received a **** nor do I have any payments on my portal. They also are trying to send the old homeowners to collections. This place is awful, horrible customer service and all over the place. Anyone who answers the phone either has NO idea how to help or is RUDE.

They turn down buyers on sell of your house so its impossible to sell, they over charge and threaten you to collections over payments that dont even exist or that you dont owe, once you finally sell your house they expect you to continue to pay the loan of solar for a couple months until they can transfer everything and if you dont they make threats to put your account into collections.

Message: I purchased a solar panels and battery through a highly rated company and they use Goodleap for the loan. Goodleap then contacted me to see if I was interested in refinancing my home to absorb the loan. The interest rate offered was not competitive, a 'higher-up' contacted me to see what they could do and I heard nothing after that. No response at all after they reached out to me asking for another opportunity to re-quote me a rate. When the billing date approached, they reached out to me asking for payment information. I said I would pay it in full and asked for an address to send the payment to which they gave me and I sent. They acknowledge they received the payment prior to the due date, yet I still owed almost $300 in accrued interest? Apparently the fine print in the contract states that you will be paying interest for 60 days prior to the payment due date. Do not do business with these people.

Message: We started our refinance process on a whim after learning that our new solar installation loan could be bundled into a refinanced mortgage with some fees waived.  We worked primarily with ********************* and *******************.  These two people really made the difference when it comes to the customer service and professionalism that that we experienced.  **** jumped on a Zoom meeting, in the time of Covid and geographic distance (we are in ****, ** and he was in **********, **) and walked us through the savings we would enjoy at a lower interest rate with the waiving of some fees to do it.  Overall, my wife and I saved over $54K in interest by refinancing and it's a great time to do it before the Fed increases interest rates to fight inflation too.  If you're seeking to refinance your home mortgage, right now (late 2021) is the time to do it.  I highly recommend working with GoodLeap.  They were absolutely amazing to work with.  Thanks, **** and **** for making this experience possible.  It was so quick (early November to late December), easy, painless that I will shout it from the rooftops if I can.  Our experience was simply nothing short of fantastic!

Message: I have an account on good standing with Goodleap. I recently reached out to the company, as my legal name has changed.  Being a trans women, getting all my accounts properly titled under my new legal name has been a priority for me. When reaching out I was told they could only add my proper name as an additional name line and couldn't change my legal name on the loan. This makes absolutely no sense, and when speaking to the supervisor (*******) about it, not only did he dead name me, he misgendered me multiple times, even after being corrected. Then after the third time he even laughed at me. Business practices that don't respect all individuals in discriminatory. To add on to that he wouldn't allow me to speak with another supervisor or transfer me to his bosses corrected to file a complaint. After multiple "accidents", I hung up. I called back to speak with another representative and was told I would receive a call back. It's been two weeks and I've yet to hear back. I would not recommend doing busy with this company at all.

Name: Nathan K.

Message: I was happy to receive a home improvement loan through Goodleap (though anywhere would have been fine).  It was easy enough.  I have great credit so I wasn't very concerned over approval... then they became a nightmare.October... No billing statements for 3 months via mail or online.  I could make a payment online but it didn't really help since I didn't know what I owned for a monthly payment.  I set up auto-payment and I made a large ($30000 payment) as I was no longer feeling very secure in using this business... I figured the autopayment would at least keep me from missing a payment since they didn't show balances, amounts due, or provide any legally required statements or notification of issues with statements.The next month (November) I logged into their site.  The site showed I made a payment and had a pending auto payment of around $170 but nothing else.  No statements, no information at all.  It reminded me of when you deal with a fraudulent ******.  Did I mention nothing had come in the mail either?I called to find out what was going on (November) with my account.  The GoodLeap representative was well aware of their failure to provide statements for months.  I asked for an account payoff  amount after determining they cannot be trusted to adhere to federal regulations and did not have the customers interests in mind...   I paid off the entire balance I was given for my account (around $10k)... goodbye savings, but better to have $0 left in savings than to continue to trust this organization.  After this final payment, I no longer had access to the goodleap website.  SO no more account updates.  I figured this was ok since I paid everything off...December 15, 2021... So today I received a **** from Goodleap in the mail.  The **** states I am overdue $45 and the total amount due must be paid by Dec 17th.  This statement was created Dec 2, they just waited to mail it until it was almost due/overdue.  I called goodleap again after waiting for them to open.  Why?  How can I have made a $30000 payment, then a final complete payoff amount which they provided, then 1 month later receive a statement saying I was "overdue" $45 from the month prior.  To be clear, Nov autopayment would have been $170ish... I paid approximately $10,000...  an approximate overpayment of $9830.  How in the world can that translate to being overdue $45 a mere 27 days later?The call was quite revealing... The $45 was to clear a lien they placed on my solar equipment in case I never paid... even though I was never late nor did I ever miss a payment, despite their greatest efforts to try to cause me to default on the payments by not providing statements, online access, payoff amounts, etc.  After everything was paid off, they decided I should have to pay to clear the lien they placed against me.  They claimed the $45 was based on the state and county of the home.Why am I paying to clear a 5-6 month account's lien when I never missed a payment, I never gave any reason to think a lien would be required, and I payed off 10 years early, etc.?  If Goodleap decided to place a lien against my solar equipment, and I never defaulted on payments:  Why am I paying to remove the lien which was obviously never needed?  Why did my statement just show this as an overdue amount instead of what it actually was claimed to be?So that was my experience.  The business failed to comply with federal billing requirements, placed a lien against my home, made it impossible to get a real payoff amount, misrepresented fees on statements... then said "if you don't pay the $45, you can expect that the lien will take a long time for us to clear and that will affect you and your home."If any of this sound like something that you'd like to experience... you should definitely go with this company... otherwise, I'd find a more reputable organization.

Message: Worst financial company (BadLeap)! Used them to purchase solar panels at first it was ok. This company does not want you to pay off your loan at any time. We refinanced our home (thankfully not with goodleap) and included the cost of the solar panels in the refinancing. We got all our ducks in a row and got the payoff amount from them and sent in the check. Out of all the bills we paid off they were the only company who lost or claims they didn't receive their check. So another check was sent and they still added interest of 30$  we paid that amount and that should be the end of the loan correct? Nope, we still owe **** on this loan. if you want to be pennied to death then this is the place to go the stamp, paper, and envelope cost more than 7 cents to send out. I guess even though we did everything properly they had to get 3**** more out of us. Total c*** company. In my opinion, do not do business with this company at all.

Message: Goodleap is absolutely awful with respect to its lending practices.  More specifically, they lack transparency with their billing, interest, and customer support.  Their page for billing/payment does not keep a running balance with daily interest charges, nor does it provide convenient payoff totals.  You have to call for a payoff quote which, as I stated before, lacks transparency.  In my specific case I was attempting to pay off my loan.  I made a payment which did not appear in their system so the only quote they could provide was inaccurate.  Then the gentleman on the phone said I would also have to pay a fee for termination of the loan which was not in the contract for the loan.  All in all, the site they manage is poor at best, and at worse it is designed this way on purpose to make it as difficult as possible to pay off the debt.  There are plenty of other lenders out there, I would suggest using someone other than Goodleap.

After providing ************** with the same mailing address that I have, she advised me that she would forward that information to the accounting department. That phone call with ************** call was about three weeks ago.Since my last conversation with ***** P, I still have not received my overpayment check. I have called customer service multiple times and no one has been able to help me. In addition, I put in multiple call back requests for a supervisor to return my call and no one has ever returned my call. I even put in a request to speak with the supervisor that I spoke to initially, ***** P to call me back and she refused by telling the customer representative that she could not speak with me nor did she ever return my second call back request.Today is November 11, 2021, Veterans day, almost two months since I received the initial payoff letter correspondence letter from Loanpal stating that I would receive an overpayment check. I called customer service again today and spoke with a customer representative named ******. The first representative that answered the call just put me on hold and just transferred me to another representative without any notification. Unfortunately that has been my experience with the customer service representatives that work at Loanpal. During my conversation with ******, she advised me that my mailing address needed to be updated in order for a second check to be mailed to me. I advised ****** that I had verified that information when I spoke to ************** three weeks ago. I again requested to speak to a supervisor and waited on hold for 50 minutes to be told yet again that a supervisor was not available to speak to me. I am highly dissatisfied with the poor service that I have received from Loanpal except for ******, who tried to help me the best way that she could.I will NOT do business with Loanpal ever again or recommend this company to any of my friends or neighbors.

It is an abuse, we will end up paying more interest than principal. I would never use this company again. It was a big mistake to have met them and let ourselves be fooled by them.

Just the facts, ma'am. Take it or not, was up to me.  Much better than the experience with the company I had dealt with for years, including a refi. They could not meet the deal. Communication all through, from many people that properly identified themselves and had great phone etiquette, such a rarity these days. Closing experience matched the rest of it.

Message: Originally, I started out as a solar customer of ********************** (now ***********************... no problems there.  Later, I decided to try going with them to refinance our VA mortgage loan.  It started out great, working with ******... good communication, clarity with what documents he needed to move forward with the loan.  It wasn't until our loan was transferred to *****************, our loan processor, that communication came to a complete halt.In fact, I didn't even know she had our file, until I reached out to ******, & was then told about it.  And by that time, an entire week had passed by.  With *****, there was no reaching out on her part... if I had any questions, I had to call, email, or message her through a message link I was provided... & even then, I wasn't guaranteed a call-back.  Most of the time, I would have to call her, if I needed something... the thing is, 99% of the times I called her, it would just be sent straight to her voicemail.  And, those weren't the only issues I was having with this company.I don't know if the underwriters were new at their job, or what... but, every time I would provide them with documents they requested, they would then decide they needed something else... this went on for more than a month.  A month after my *** termite inspection results were sent to them, along with other documents they had decided they needed, they halt the process to tell me that I needed to have an issue fixed, that was noted on the *** termite inspection... which, not only has this same issue been noted on two previous *** termite inspections (from two previous VA mortgage refinance loans), but was an already existing issue, long before we bought the house... & has never been a problem.On top of that, the underwriters took the amount of our cash back, from $51k to $10k thats a big step back.  The worst part is, they just dragged this on for more than a month... when, had there been proper communication (or just communication at all), we would've had more time to straighten this out.Now, we're screwed, because the entire purpose of wanting to get our mortgage loan refinanced is for the cash back... which we were going to use to pay off some bills, & set some aside for savings... & possibly some home improvement projects.  Now, there's little to no chance that the GoodLeap underwriters will approve this loan for closing... 60 days & dropped credit scores (from them requesting our credit reports), all for nothing.  What I do know is, after our solar loan is paid off, I will NEVER go through this company again, for anything.

Message: holy smokes.  I made a payment through my bank on the 1st of the month.  The Bank sends the check and it takes a while to get there, but that is out of my hands.  So a Goodleap representative calls every month and I politely tell them that I have made the payment and give the check number and the confirmation number along with a screen shot sent to customer service that the money has left my bank.  This month THE VERY NEXT DAY, I receive a call and they ask the same thing.  I asked if they have the notes on my account and they confirm yes, they do.  I then point out that all this information was just given yesterday and then I ask them what they hope to get from calling and she states the $42.11 that is overdue.  This month I sent them 5 times + the monthly amount on the 1st hoping that this doesn't continue every month.  Guess, just guess who called me again today?  You are correct.  Still want that $42.11.  I sure hope that $500 gets there today.  WARNING:  If you can finance with another company, I would highly advise that.  I am going tomorrow go secure a loan with my bank to get this loan paid off.  Perhaps they have people that don't pay their debts and need to stay on top of those people.  I would say to that that they should do better research to the people they loan money to.  They should not have to worry about people that have a 840 credit score.  WILL NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN!

I called in July to address being charged even though I paid it off. They said I had to get a pay off letter and it would take 3 weeks before this would go through because what I paid was not the actual amount. I never got the letter and kept getting charged. It is now September. I got the customer service I needed today to get into my account. 10 weeks after pay off I finally got a letter that confirmed I had paid off my loan. I stopped autopay. Crossing my fingers that after three more phone calls and more run around that this is finally paid off and they will stop charging me. My loan was orginally through a different company and they became GoodLeap. Avoid these guys. Their customer service is rude and their processes take FOREVER.

Email to customer service with questions about account went unanswered.  As a result, "final" fees to pay-off loan kept arriving for three months. Finally, I refused to get off the phone with customer service until it was sent to me via email.  A questionable final fee - a so-called loan termination fee - was listed on most recent monthly statement as "overdue" despite not never having been shown on previous monthly statement. That amount as listed on the monthly statement did not agree with the amount shown payoff statement.All in all, a very unpleasant experience.

We've called every day for almost 2 weeks straight, and they've given us a total of 7 different answers. We called today 8/25/2021 and they got snippy with me and told me that they don't have the paperwork and to get with out old realtor. If I wanted to throw money away, there are more reputable companies to do so.

Message: If I could give 0 stars I would. I would like to begin by saying that I received multiple calls from loan pal offering to consolidate my mortgage with my solar panel payment to have one payment. This sounded great since I just had a baby and my wife has been out for work. I decided to go ahead and refinance to just have one payment. It took over 3 months going back and forth with them asking for more and more paperwork. After all said and done, I got a call from loan pal saying I was three months late on my solar payment. Turns out they did not consolidate the two accounts. This was the only reason why I refinanced. I called the person I was working with and all they said was "well you signed it, and it must have been a miscommunication, but if you like we can refinance again to go ahead and consolidate" Not only that they charged me $17,000+ in closing cost. How is that possible, my sister refinanced her house and they charged her $3,000. I feel like they took advantage of my inexperience. Please be careful when dealing with them. Don't let this happen to you.

Message: The worst customer service and company to deal with! I highly suggest you find another loan company to secure assumption of your solar panels. As new home buyers GoodLeap credit rating system is flawed. Be aware that the Soft Pull and Hard Pull they did for us made us ineligible for the loan yet we our credit score is eligible for lending. It was a only 2 day difference in the credit pull and yet the discrepency of a 50 point credit drop on GoodLeap's in shut the deal down. Mind you our lender wanted answers along with us, Can you believe GoodLeap representatives would assist us in pertaining a solution as too why the ratings were so drastically different. All in all, despite the software they are using for a credit pull, the fact that we couldn't get any feedback or speak to someone in loans that could encourage other solutions made me realize how unsatisfactory the goal of seeking help for customers is for this company. A huge Disappointment, Let's not mention we couldn't get a legit link in the email to secure the application, nor did we receive a conformation email showing we completed the application. It was almost like we were chasing down help, answers and solutions on our own.  Look at all the one star reviews, compared to 5 stars. DO yourselves a favor and find another company! #Expeditiously Its HARD NO for ** and honestly I don't want to even ***** them with one Star. Horrible

Name: Katie O

Message: I was contacted by someone who got me in contact with ***************************, who was insistent that a refinance could be quick and provide an opportunity to pull equity to consolidate debt. I expressed in the very beginning of our conversations my hesitation with refinancing to any company that would sell my loan to a servicer. ***** assured me that though selling to a servicer was possible, it was unlikely. We discussed two different options for drawing equity from the property, either consolidating my solar loan into the new mortgage or paying down a portion of the solar loan and getting $20k in cash for debt consolidation. After I ran my own numbers, I decided the second option was the best decision for us and communicated that to *****. I did not hear from ***** throughout the remainder of my processing, rather I dealt with two other ladies I assume were from his team. I was told I would need an appraisal but that GoodLeap would cover the expense of that. I was shocked to see on our final paperwork that 1) the cost for the appraisal was included in our loan, meaning we were paying for it 2) my request for cash out had been ignored and ***** or whoever had drafted the loan to pay off the entirety of the solar loan which is what we had discussed and I had decided against and 3) my interest rate was higher than I had been promised. However, the notary employed by GoodLeap to finalize the paperwork quite literally followed us while we were driving and bullied us into signing everything. I felt lied to and coerced. And then, 28 days before my first payment was due, I received notice that my loan had been sold to a gd servicer. I genuinely pray that this company goes bankrupt within the next two years, bunch of scam artists and liars.

They keep telling me to check my online account (It's empty. They didn't load that month correctly). I tried multiple browsers. So, then they tell me it will take 3-5 business days to get an email copy sent to me. I never got one the first three calls I made. The fourth call they actually sent me an email copy...the wrong statement. I made a significant payment that time and now I can't even get a copy of the statement showing that payment. I'm very frustrated! And I'm told they are not allowed to give us their billing department's phone number. There is only one number on their website to call. This company is rediculus! I'd recommend not going through them for your soloar loan. Plus, you are more likely to get a better interest rate at another company. I'm stuck with them until I can refinance, or pay off our loan.

Message: GoodLeap made statements, claiming the load is a simple loan like a credit card or car loan however, with both of the examples all fees are clearly outlined in loan disclosure. I have read and re-read the loan disclosure and no where in the documentation does it discuss or do I agree to a per diem for the loan or is the loan termed a simple loan. I pay my loan early monthly yet the interest rate that I am charge displays as if I am paying late. This is because of "the payment to payment rule" they are trying to slide under the table, My payments are received around the ***** of every month my due date is not till the 23rd but depending on the month it seems my payments are ***** days late. Allowing them to Collect additional interest for "per diem" I guess being not being penalized for paying early is a tongue and cheek buzz word they like to use. The document I sign discloses that continuous early and over the monthly payments will cause the loan to re-amortize. The website does not  track monthly payments to accounts, This is a simple change of tying the account to the the borrowers actual account, many companies do this so that borrowers can track their accounts on their own even utilities, credit cards and car companies do this. The only reason I can see not doing this is they can pull the nonsense they are pulling with me, GoodLeap does not want people that do not want companies dipping into their bank accounts or those that chose to make self monthly payments to see what's going on with the account. when I called them on it they only point to an non-existent payment to payment rule stated in my agreement. GoodLeap didn't offer any solution to solve any of their issues aside from we hope to fix the website in the future, and they are following the terms of a simple interest loan which is not what I signed with them, blatantly made claims that were not in the original contract. I suggest no one use GoodLeap as a solar loan company.

Message: Misogynistic, time wasting liars. I began a refi process with LoanPal in Dec of 21. After about 3 months of no result and constant requests for more and more paperwork that revolved around the fact that I was a divorced, single mother, I was informed that I could not qualify for a loan large enough to bundle in my solar panels. I went ahead with refi of my house anyway, because rates were so low. However, it got to be such a hassle that I told them I was no longer interested in working with them no was told you will never see a rate this low again.  so I stuck it out. Every time they sent me an updated loan estimate, the numbers were different. The percentage they were charging me climbed.  My final straw was when I was asked to obtain a certified letter from my EX HUSBAND verifying that he intended to continue support payments (on top of me already providing divorce documents with his support order in them). It is none of my exes business what I do, so I was outraged at the misogynistic way this company was handling my refi. I finally left after months of being jerked around by these guys, and went to a local lender who not only qualified me for a much LOWER rate, they also easily included the solar loan AND gave me a check back in the end (goodleap was asking me to pay to close my loan). Where GL wasted months of my time, my local lender closed it in less than a month with zero hassle or the needless and sexist documentation I had been asked for by GL. If you are a single or divorced woman, go somewhere else. This company caters to men. How do I know? My neighbora divorced manwas also refiing with them and was not asked for even half of the documents I was. I made more money than him AND had a top notch credit score. Welcome to 2021, Goodleap. Please treat your customers fairly instead of hiding behind a name change.

Message: I can't even give them a star.  Worst company I've ever dealt with. Every time you call or they call you, you talk to someone different and they tell you something different.  I was supposed to have my payment automatically taken out of my bank, and I signed papers back in January when I started my solar process.  Then I received a **** - which I should not have since it was to be automatic. The **** was for more than I agreed to and when I called I was told that I didn't sign up for auto pay which is why it was higher. I told them I did and had signed papers. The man told me to send them to the customer service email - which I did explaining everything. NO one has ever called me back from that email, even though I asked them to and included my phone number and my account number. So the same man helped me with auto pay and I thought I was set. I received an email when the **** was due that it was rejected. When I called this time the woman said that lots of their customers had problems with emails, and that the company had technical issues where bills showed rejection, but she looking into my account and said it went through and was paid.  I watched my bank account and nothing showed up. I received a call today that I needed to take care of the ****. I explained to this girl, not nicely I'm ashamed to say, all my frustrations with the past few phone calls - and even told her about 2 phone calls telling me what a great customer I was; one I even tried to tell one of those agents about my situation with auto pay - she said "since you've already talked to someone we don't need to discuss it"... I have set up my online auto pay THREE times, and with each person I talked to.  This agent today told me I needed to talk to my bank, and I told her again that the other woman said it was on the company's end. Very poor excuse for customer service and everyone on the same page. It's like no one knows what they are doing and they just tell you something to make you happy...which I'm not. So frustrated...******

Message: Where I find your company very negligent is when you pre-approve someone to assume the transfer of a loan, to then turn around a few weeks later and deny them, based on something as basic as credit history is absurd.  The entire deal fell apart (last minute too) for a family in desperate need to buy my home, and the sellers of the home I was going to purchase, are now stuck with 2 mortgages and have to start over from scratch.   Not to mention I personally lost thousands because of this dropped ball in due diligence and trust money.   How much everyone involved has lost out on is a # I cant even wrap my brain around.                  I would assume/imagine something is basic as credit history would be something your company would do a better job at in the vetting process for a pre-approval.  I know this doesnt affect anyone at loanpal personally, or whoever provided the pre-approval, but it is extremely discouraging/frustrating that no one is accountable on the end of Loanpal.   This significantly impacted the lives of many different individuals.

Message: We put in a new solar system.  Loan Pal is the company that made the loan for this system.  When the loan was made, we were pressured to sign up for direct payment from our bank account.  I asked if this was a requirement and, reluctantly after I told them I had been in the banking field for 30+ years, was told no.  I set up payment through my bank a few days before the payment was due.  ******* was sent to Loan Pal who did not post the payment for up to a month afterward.  I was hounded several times a day by e-mail, phone calls, and text to make a payment.  Same thing happened the next month, so I made 2 extra payments, which again were delayed by Loan Pal in posting.  I finally had to allow them to take payments from my account - which is what they pushed for all along.I now want to reduce my balance, which we are to do within 18 months of making the loan.  I called to do this, but the "system" was down, I needed to call back later.  I called back several hours later, once they knew what I wanted to do, the system was down again - I should call back later.  I said no, I wanted to speak to a supervisor - I had to ask 3 times.  They kept me on hold 2 times, then "miraculously" the system was back up and did I want to make the payment?  I said, no I still wanted to speak to a supervisor, they said they would have one call me back.  I'm tired of their questionable tactics.  I would not use this company ever again and suggest no one else use them either.   I would leave negative stars if possible.

Back in 2018 I decided to look into solar panels and ultimately went with Sol(ius for the panels and Loanpal for the financing.  I was told that I would receive tax incentives in the range of 55% of the total cost of the panels.  The breakdown was 35% ******* and 20% State and if I where to send those rebates to Loanpal my monthly payments of $169.00 would stay at that amount for the remainder of the 19 yr loan and if I kept those rebates may payments would go up to $240.00 per month.  So I had full intentions of sending those rebates to Loanpal, as tempting as it might be to just keep it.  This was the first lie.  The 35% was more like 12 to 15% for *******, that was the "not so bad" lie, and the state 20% wasn't even a rebate at all.  Even though it was closer to the 20% I was told, it was in the form of, if you ended up owing anything to state the rebate would cover that amount.  Since the amount financed for the panels was $32,370 the 20% would be $6,474.  I don't make a lot of money, I live comfortable, but I've never come close to owing that much to state.  But here is the cherry on top, that $6,474 would be available with a cap of $2,000 per year up to ten years.  Since I normally get money back from both state and federal the only way I could benefit from this would be to change the number of dependents I claim during the year so they would take less taxes out.  This was a balancing act not to go over the $2,000 cap per year.  So ultimately my payments have gone up to the $240 per month, ****!!!  Now comes something that wasn't a lie but I have searched the contract/agreement and couldn't find anything on it.  There is a maximum production of 5kw on the panels at any given time, so unless you leave something on that uses a lot of power during the day, your air conditioning unit for example, you'll never utilize all the power during the day.  So you might be thinking well if your panels produce more than you use the power company will buy that power back from you and use it on their grid.  Check your local power company, because unless you have a license to sell power that is not going to happen, and unless things have changed in my area battery storage is not allowed.  Even worse than that, any surplus of power, the power company sells it back to you after the sun goes down.  Insert that pile of excrement emoji.  In the winter time, for me at least, the panels only produce somewhere in the range of 2kw and I have gas heat so the savings are even less.  However I won't knock anyone for me having gas heat I will overlook it.  As I said in the beginning I will accept that I didn't do the research I should have, so to be fair and just deal with it.  Now here it is 2021 and I'm currently doing a refi on my house and I'm saving a decent amount by doing so.  So I wanted to put the remaining balance of the  panels in with my loan, I'm purchasing the panels not leasing them.  So I call ******************** to get a 15 day payoff on a loan that I paid $169 per month until the beginning of 2020 and $240 per month every since then, keep in mind that the interest rate is 5.99% which is not great but a lot less than some credit cards I've seen, and the balance due of the original %32,370 is (drum roll...) $31,158.  Insert middle finger emoji.  I guess there should be a picture of my face for the idiot emoji.  Anyway just look over the entire contract and check with your local power company before you make such a large investment.  It isn't all bad though, in the summer it does pay to have the panels.  I can keep my house colder than I probably need to and the actual savings can be significant.  The highest power **** I have ever had in this house is $350 or so and the lowest **** in the heat of summer was $50, this includes the $15 and $5 per month for service and one street light respectively.  I live in South Carolina so it does get pretty **** hot here.  I hope this helps at least one person about to make the plunge into solar.  Thanks for reading.I'MADJ

Name: Sam Fosness

Message: The owner of a Mitchell roofing business has been charged with three counts of felony drug possession after a search warrant was executed Thursday at Mitchell Roofing and Siding and the owner's Aurora County residence. Cory Cumings, owner of Mitchell Roofing and Siding, was charged with possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), a Class 5 felony that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine; possession of marijuana wax, a Class 5 felony; and keeping place for use or sale of a controlled substance, a Class 5 felony. Cumings, 44, was also charged with a pair of misdemeanor charges, including one count of stalking and permitting threatening or harassing phone calls, which are each Class 1 misdemeanors. Those charges stem from Aurora County and were filed in state criminal court. A spokesperson for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told the Mitchell Republic on Thursday night that the ATF was executing a federal search warrant with other agencies in Mitchell. ATF said one person was taken into custody in the execution of the warrant in Aurora County, about 15 miles west of Mitchell. The contents of the federal warrant remain sealed, the spokesperson said, and the ATF did not disclose the nature of the operation in Mitchell. According to an arrest affidavit, authorities searched Cumings' Aurora County residence and uncovered approximately 3 ounces of marijuana wax and a scale with residue that tested positive for methamphetamine. An agent with the South Dakota Department of Criminal Investigation assisted ATF agents in the search of Cumings’ Aurora County residence and Mitchell roofing business, the affidavit said. The misdemeanor charges against Cumings stem from a phone call between Cumings and a female victim. An affidavit alleges Cumings threatened to “hire a hitman” to kill the woman. The victim recorded the alleged phone call and reported it to authorities, according to court documents. Davison County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Friday morning that Cumings was booked at the Davison County jail. When a defendant is arrested and apprehended in Aurora County, they are booked at the Davison County jail. Throughout much of Thursday afternoon and into the evening, law enforcement vehicles were parked in front of Mitchell Roofing and Siding, located at 1000 S. Main St. Patrol vehicles had emergency lights activated while parked in front of the business. Among the law enforcement agencies that were at Mitchell Roofing and Siding were the South Dakota Highway Patrol, South Dakota Department of Criminal Investigation, Mitchell Police Department, Davison County Sheriff’s Office and several unmarked vehicles officers were seen operating. ATF confirmed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's investigative arm Homeland Security Investigations was also on hand. HSI is responsible for investigating criminal activity involving the United States' travel, trade, financial and immigration systems, according to its website. Harr said the Davison County Sheriff’s Office is not leading any investigations related to Thursday’s search on the Mitchell business. A spokesperson for the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation also referred questions to the ATF. Mitchell Roofing and Siding has been in business since 2001 and serves customers in South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Wyoming, according to its website.
